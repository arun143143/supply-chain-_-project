                    "body": "SEATTLE (AP) -- Oliver Bjorkstrand scored twice and Philipp Grubauer made 33 saves as the Seattle Kraken beat the Boston Bruins 5-1 on Thursday night.\n\nJaden Schwartz and Vince Dunn also scored for the Kraken. Jared McCann had an empty-net goal and an assist, and Shane Wright added two assists.\n\nBrad Marchand scored on a penalty shot for Boston in the second period.\n\nSeattle jumped to a 2-0 lead early in the first. Bjorkstrand scored on a power play 24 seconds into the game, just eight seconds after David Pastrnak took a double minor for high-sticking. Schwartz backhanded the puck over goalie Joonas Korpisalo about five minutes later.\n\nDunn batted the puck into Boston's net early in the third period and the goal stood after a replay review. Seattle made it 4-1 when Wright set up Bjorkstrand for his 11th goal at 9:16.\n\nBjorkstrand has 14 points in his last 11 games.\n\nKraken: A total of 10 skaters recorded at least a point for Seattle.\n\nBruins: Have allowed 13 goals in the first two games of their road trip.\n\nA shot by John Beecher slipped underneath Grubauer with 9:32 left in the second period, and Brandon Montour dove into the paint to stop the puck. A review determined the puck did not completely cross the goal line, but Montour was penalized for covering the puck in the crease. Marchand was awarded a penalty shot and scored.\n\nThe Bruins outshot the Kraken 34-21.\n\nThe Kraken host Tampa Bay on Saturday, when the Bruins continue their five-game trip in Vancouver.",

We have to hang in there for the time being.\"\n\nMadrid make the short trip to Rayo Vallecano on Saturday knowing they can snatch top spot from Barcelona, for 24 hours at least, before next week's Intercontinental Cup final in Qatar.\n\nBut they could be without Mbappe due to the hamstring problem he suffered on Tuesday.\n\n\"Mbappe has some discomfort in his hamstrings. It doesn't seem serious but we'll see,\" Ancelotti said after the Atalanta game.\n\n\"He couldn't sprint, it hurt him a bit and we thought it best to replace him.\"\n\nBarcelona host a struggling Leganes on Sunday attempting to arrest their domestic dip in form, with a run of one win in five games opening the door to their title rivals.\n\nAtletico are three points adrift of Barcelona having also played a game less, and have won five in a row in La Liga going into Sunday's home derby with Getafe.\n\nNot far behind are Athletic Bilbao, whose 2-0 win at Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce on Wednesday pushed them closer to the Europa League last 16.\n\nAthletic, unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions, are going for a fifth straight league win away to Alaves this weekend, while Villarreal and Real Betis meet in a clash of teams whose results have tailed off recently.\n\nPlayer to watch: Julian Alvarez\n\nThe Argentine is Atletico's top scorer with 12 goals overall since his August arrival from Manchester City.\n\nThe 24-year-old left England seeking a new challenge after largely playing second fiddle to Erling Haaland despite his critical role in his country's 2022 World Cup triumph.\n\nAlvaraz set Atletico on their way to a 3-1 win over Slovan Bratislava midweek with a terrific curling effort before Antoine Griezmann's double sealed the points.\n\n\"He's a great player,\" said Griezmann, who himself is in a rich vein of form with seven goals in his last five outings. \"It's a joy and a source of pride to have him with us and to be able to help him.\"\n\nKey stats\n\n5 - after failing to score until November 9, Jude Bellingham has now found the net in each of Madrid's last five league games\n\n8 - months since Valencia's last away league win, a 1-0 victory at Osasuna in April\n\n10 - consecutive wins for Atletico in La Liga, the Champions League and Copa del Rey\n\nEspanyol v Osasuna (1300), Mallorca v Girona (1515), Sevilla v Celta Vigo (1730), Rayo Vallecano v Real Madrid (2000)\n\nSunday\n\nAtletico Madrid v Getafe (1300), Alaves v Athletic Bilbao (1515), Villarreal v Real Betis, Real Sociedad v Las Palmas (both 1730), Barcelona v Leganes (2000)",

                    "body": "The Lakeland Dreadnaughts have been making plays all season.\n\nHeck, the Class 5A program has historically been making plays. If the program would have won Thursday night at Pitbull stadium, the Dreadnaughts would have won a third straight championship. But that didn't happen, as St. Thomas Aquinas won the state championship 34-0.\n\nStill, there were some good plays witnessed by the dozens of Dreadnaught faithful who made the three-and-a-half hour trip to Miami from Polk County. And while the final score was lopsided, at one point the game was in question, and there was one particular play that made it feel like Lakeland would inevitably come back just like against Niceville in the state semifinals -- a 34-33 win.\n\nBelow are top plays from Lakeland in the state championship.\n\nMcKinney makes huge interception\n\nWith the game at 17-0 in favor of St. Thomas Aquinas in the second quarter, senior cornerback Kavon McKinney on a second-and-11 play intercepted the ball, which should have been a huge swing play. Mckinney was able to run it back 31 yards, too.\n\n\"It's regular to me. 12 interceptions in two years. I stay consistent,\" McKinney said after the game.\n\nDobie sets tone early\n\nThe Dreadnaughts are a run-first team, and that stayed consistent early on and throughout the game. Junior running back Jadarius Dobie took a handoff from starting quarterback Zander Smith and took off for 32 yards with 11:09 left in the first quarter. Dobie looked like a gazelle running away from hungry lions, beating those predators to the corner.\n\nRiley makes huge play\n\nAs for hungry lions, that's what the Dreadnaughts were early in the contest when the game was still in question. Junior strong safety Ziggy Riley made a tackle on running back Cedric Wyche on third down and under a 1:30 left in the second when the score was 17-0. The play was a momentum-swinging play that should have galvanized the entire team.\n\nYoung picks up the fumble\n\nAnother play that could have inspired the squad was a play in which senior full safety Keon Young picked up a fumble with 5:04 in the third quarter down 20-0. This kind of momentum-swinging play made the Lakeland crowd erupt with euphoria, which should have led to the game's first points.\n\nOther top plays were junior running back Malik Morris and Dobie picking up first downs. Morris picked up his first on fourth-and-2 with 5 minutes left in the first half, while Dobie ran for his for 12 yards with 7 minutes left in the third.",

                    "body": "Notably, this is not the first time Bam is investing in a startup as he invested in a creator-owned marketplace startup HYPD in 2022\n\nD2C sexual wellness brand Peppy has roped in content creator Bhuvan Bam as an investor and cofounder.\n\nIn a statement, Peppy said it raised $500K in a pre-seed round, led by Bam, BBKV Productions cofounder and CEO Rohit Raj, among others, in May this year.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that BBKV Productions is a subsidiary of BB Ki Vines Private Limited, which is owned by Bam.\n\nPeppy, founded in 2023 by Devansh Agarwal and Shyamal Gupta, sells a range of sexual wellness products for both men and women, including massagers and lubricants. During its last fundraise, which saw participation from Bam and other angel investors, the D2C brand was valued at INR 50 Cr.\n\n\"With Bhuvan and Rohit's signature creativity and knack for connecting with people, we're breaking barriers and normalising conversations around pleasure,\" Peppy cofounders said in a statement.\n\nThe partnership will enable Peppy to leverage Bam's online popularity to \"connect\" with masses and tout its products to a wider audience. Notably, this is not the first time that Bam has invested in a startup. In 2022, he invested in a creator-owned marketplace startup HYPD.\n\nCommenting on the investment, Bam said, \"... While society has made significant changes in many areas, the taboo surrounding physical intimacy continues to hold people back. By collaborating with Peppy, I aim to help people overcome these societal norms and empower individuals to embrace their journey toward intimacy with confidence and ease.\"\n\nPeppy, in the statement, said that it is now in the process of raising a seed round of $1 Mn to $2 Mn with an eye on expanding its sales channels and market reach.\n\nThe startup competes with brands like Bold Care, MyMuse, Kindly, among others. Last year, Bold Care also roped in actor Ranveer Singh as its co-owner.\n\nThe development comes at a time when more and more celebrities are investing in Indian startups. As many as 19 celebrities, including Deepika Padukone, Raveer Singh, Karan Johar, KL Rahul, among others, have infused capital into 21 startups so far this year\n\nNotably, the Indian sexual wellness market is witnessing healthy investor interest lately. In January this year, MyMuse raised a Pre-Series A round of $2.7 Mn from Trifecta Capital and CRED's founder Kunal Shah in a mix of debt and equity to strengthen its omnichannel presence.\n\nLast year, feminine hygiene startup Sirona forayed into the sexual wellness market with the acquisition of vegan condom brand Ble\u00fc.",

Miller each had two assists for the Canucks. Lankinen's shutout was the sixth of his NHL career.\n\nSergei Bobrovsky made 15 saves for the Panthers, who were 6-0-1 in their last seven games and lost in regulation for the first time since Nov. 25. Florida was shut out for the first time this season.\n\nMiller returned to Vancouver's lineup after missing nearly four weeks for personal reasons.\n\nCanucks: Defenseman Derek Forbort also returned to a Vancouver lineup that has been riddled with injuries and absences. All-star goalie Thatcher Demko made his first start of the season on Tuesday, leaving defenseman Filip Hronek (lower body) as the lone Canucks player on the injured-reserve list.\n\nPanthers: It's not often the offense sputters. Florida came into the game ranked fifth in the league in goals with an average of 3.66 per game. The Panthers also entered with the fifth-best power play (27.4%) but went scoreless on two man-advantages.\n\nLankinen was tested several times, including a Panthers power play midway through the second period.

                    "title": "What Americans think about Hegseth, Gabbard and key Trump Cabinet picks: AP-NORC poll",
                    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- As several of President-elect Donald Trump's choices for high-level positions in his incoming administration face scrutiny on Capitol Hill, a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that Americans have their own doubts.\n\nRelatively few Americans overall approve of Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice to lead the Department of Defense, or Tulsi Gabbard, his pick for intelligence chief, although a substantial share doesn't know who those figures are. The other selections who were included in the poll, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health secretary and Marco Rubio for secretary of state, are more well-known but not much more popular among Americans overall.\n\nTrump and his allies are pushing Republican senators to confirm his picks, who are meeting with lawmakers before Trump returns to the White House next month. Given the Republicans' slim majority in the Senate, the stakes are high for each Trump pick.\n\nOnly about 2 in 10 Americans approve of Hegseth's nomination\n\nAn Army veteran and former Fox News commentator, Hegseth has been trying to make his case amid allegations of excessive drinking and the revelation that he made a settlement payment after being accused of a sexual assault that he denies. Trump has reiterated his support for Hegseth, who appears to have won over some of the senators who were once critical of his selection.\n\nHegseth is still an unknown quantity for many Americans. About 4 in 10 don't know enough about him to give an opinion, according to the poll. But his selection is viewed more negatively than positively among Americans who do know who he is. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Hegseth being picked for Trump's Cabinet, while 36% disapprove and about 1 in 10 don't know enough to have an opinion.\n\nHe has higher support among Republicans, but it's not overwhelming. Many Republicans do not have an opinion of Hegseth: About 4 in 10 say they don't know enough about him. About one-third of Republicans approve of him as a pick, and 16% disapprove. Another 1 in 10 Republicans, roughly, are neutral and say they neither approve nor disapprove.\n\nThose approval numbers among Republicans are at least slightly lower for Hegseth than any of the other names included in the poll.\n\nApproval of Gabbard's nomination is also low\n\nGabbard, who represented Hawaii in the House for four terms as a Democrat, sought the 2020 presidential nomination before leaving her party. She was one of Trump's most sought-after surrogates in the 2024 campaign. Gabbard has faced new questions about her proximity to Syria amid the sudden end of Syrian President Bashar Assad's long hold on power.\n\nGabbard is as unknown as Hegseth is, but Americans are a little less likely to disapprove of her nomination. About 2 in 10 Americans approve of Trump's pick of Gabbard, while about 3 in 10 disapprove. The rest either do not know enough to say -- about 4 in 10 said this -- or have a neutral view.\n\nApproval is slightly higher among Republicans than Hegseth's, though. About 4 in 10 Republicans approve of the choice, while very few disapprove and 16% have a neutral view. Similar to Americans overall, about 4 in 10 Republicans don't know enough to say.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is better known -- and less well-liked\n\nA scion of a famous Democratic dynasty, Kennedy made a name in his own right as an environmental attorney who successfully took on large corporations. In recent decades, he has increasingly devoted his energy to promoting claims about vaccines that contradict the overwhelming consensus of scientists. Trump has said he would give Kennedy free rein over health policy -- from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nOnly 14% of Americans say they don't know enough to have an opinion about Trump's move to name Kennedy, but that greater name recognition doesn't translate into warmer feelings. About 4 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump's selection of Kennedy, while about 3 in 10 approve and 14% are neutral.\n\nOnce a contender for the Democratic presidential primary, Kennedy has become something of a GOP darling, with a strong majority of Republicans approving of him joining the Trump administration. About 6 in 10 Republicans approve, and only about 1 in 10 disapprove. About 2 in 10 are neutral, and about 1 in 10 don't know enough about him to say.\n\nAmericans split on Marco Rubio\n\nIn his third Senate term from Florida, Rubio has gone from a Trump rival for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination to one of his staunchest congressional allies. Rubio is seen as having the incoming president's ear on foreign policy issues, particularly related to Latin America.\n\nAmericans are divided about Rubio being elevated to a key Cabinet role: About 3 in 10 approve, and a similar share disapprove, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say and 15% neither approve nor disapprove.\n\nMost Republicans, nearly 6 in 10, approve, making his selection nearly as popular with this group as Kennedy's. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans disapprove, while 14% are neutral and about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.\n\nRubio, who is Cuban American, earns higher approval among Hispanic adults than some of Trump's other high-profile choices, but more still disapprove than approve.\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 1,251 adults was conducted Dec. 5-9, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.",

                    "body": "Indonesia (AFP) - A Filipina drug convict on death row in Indonesia told AFP from prison Friday that her planned transfer was a \"miracle\", in her first interview since Manila and Jakarta signed an agreement last week to repatriate her.\n\nMother of two Mary Jane Veloso, 39, was arrested and sentenced to death in 2010 after the suitcase she was carrying was found to be lined with 2.6 kilograms (5.7 pounds) of heroin, in a case that sparked uproar in the Philippines.\n\nBoth she and her supporters claim she was duped by an international drug syndicate, and in 2015, she narrowly escaped execution after her suspected recruiter was arrested.\n\n\"This is a miracle because, honestly, even now, it still feels like a dream. Every morning when I wake up, I think about my aspirations, aspirations that I never had any certainty about,\" she said when asked about the decision.\n\n\"That's why I always prayed to God, 'Lord, I only ask for one chance to go home and be with my family'. And God answered that prayer.\"\n\nLast week, Indonesia's senior law and human rights minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra said a \"practical arrangement\" had been signed for her repatriation.\n\nHe said her release could take place \"around December 20\" before Christmas and that he had heard her death penalty would be reduced to life imprisonment.\n\nVeloso's case was condemned in the Philippines, with rallies of support and world boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao pleading for her life.\n\nHer supporters said she was headed to work as a maid when she was arrested in Indonesia.\n\nShe now dreams of being reunited with her family after 14 years in prison in a case that has delivered her fame at home.\n\n\"Since I heard the news, my feelings... were leaning more towards happiness. Because after almost 15 years, that is what I am waiting for... I can go home to my country,\" she said.\n\n\"I need to prepare mentally to face it all. Be it to face my family, to face everybody out there. And physically, I must be healthy too.\"\n\nFrance, Australia talks\n\nHer family and the Philippine government hailed the repatriation agreement.\n\nVeloso's mother told AFP last week she was \"elated and surprised\" her daughter would be coming home.\n\n\"We can finally be together this Christmas,\" Celia Veloso, 65, said.\n\nAn official in Indonesia's coordinating law, human rights, immigration and corrections ministry told AFP the government was \"still preparing everything\" for her transfer.\n\nIndonesia is also in talks with Australia and France after President Prabowo Subianto had agreed to fulfil their requests to hand back some prisoners who were sentenced on drug charges.\n\nHigh-profile detainees in discussion to be transferred include Frenchman Serge Atlaoui, a welder who was arrested in 2005 in a secret drugs factory outside Jakarta, with authorities accusing him of being a \"chemist\" at the site.\n\nJakarta is also in talks with Australia over the release of the five remaining members of Australia's \"Bali Nine\" -- Matthew Norman, Si Yi Chen, Michael Czugaj, Scott Rush and Martin Stephens -- who are serving life sentences.\n\nMuslim-majority Indonesia has some of the world's toughest drug laws and has executed foreigners in the past.\n\nAt least 530 people were on death row in the Southeast Asian nation, mostly for drug-related crimes, according to data from rights group KontraS, citing official figures.\n\nAs of early November, 96 foreigners were on death row in Indonesia, all on drug charges, according to data from the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections.\n\nDespite the ongoing negotiation for prisoner transfers, the Indonesian government gave the signal last week that it will resume execution -- on hiatus since 2016 -- of drug convicts who are on death row.",

                    "body": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- With Mitt Romney set to exit the U.S. Senate, Washington will be without one of its strongest conservative critics of Donald Trump when the president retakes the White House in the new year.\n\nThe retiring senator will reflect on his two-decade political career, which included the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, a term as Massachusetts governor and several skirmishes with Trump loyalists in Congress, at a final news conference Friday in Salt Lake City.\n\nRomney, 77, chose not to run for reelection this year after representing Utah in the Senate since 2019. He has said he wants to focus on getting more young people involved in politics after he leaves office in January but has not shared specific plans.\n\nOnce the standard-bearer of the Republican Party, Romney watched his brand of moderate conservatism shift from establishment to outlier as Trump took hold of the party.\n\nHe soon became the voice of Congress' centrist core, leading negotiations for the $550 billion bipartisan infrastructure law -- one of the Biden administration's crowning achievements -- and a major COVID-19 relief package.\n\nPolitical observers worry his departure may create a vacuum of strong centrist voices who can keep bipartisanship alive at a time of increased polarization in Washington.\n\nRomney will be succeeded in the Senate by Republican U.S. Rep. John Curtis, who has developed a reputation for pushing back against party leaders such as Trump who falsely claim climate change is a hoax. Eyes will be on Curtis and other moderate Republicans who might break with the party in votes to confirm Trump's cabinet picks.\n\nIn 2020, Romney became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president from their own party in an impeachment trial. He was the sole Republican in Congress to vote to convict Trump at his two impeachment trials. Trump was acquitted by the Senate both times.\n\nEarlier this year, Romney pledged not to vote for Trump but declined to join some other high-profile Republicans in endorsing Democrat Kamala Harris, saying he wanted to preserve his future ability to help rebuild the Republican Party.",

That's all,\" said her older sister, Merve, 17.\n\nShe admitted she had \"cried a lot\" on Wednesday as her family took a bus out of Istanbul, where they had fled in 2012, a year into Syria's brutal 13-year conflict.\n\nIt was a grey, cloudy day at the Cilvegozu border crossing, and from where the Assani sisters were standing, nothing of what awaited them in Syria was visible on the horizon.\n\nA little boy in his father's arms had chocolate smeared around his mouth and a Turkish flag knotted around his neck like a cape.\n\n\"That's to thank Turkey for welcoming us,\" said the father as he hurried back to Damascus, the capital and hometown to many of the three million Syrian refugees in Turkey.\n\n- 'Kiss on the cheek' -\n\nIn a long line that had been forming since dawn, Mumina Hamid was watching over her twins, wearing a long black coat, a pink scarf on her head.\n\nHusam and Wael, age six, had just been to the barber one last time before leaving Istanbul. They had the same haircut, shaved on the sides, each with a packet of cookies in his Spider-Man backpack.\n\n\"Syria is bigger than Istanbul,\" Wael said knowingly, adding that he hoped there would be cats at their final destination, the central city of Hama.\n\nWhat would they miss about Istanbul? \"My friends,\" he said. \"And my teacher,\" he added, looking at his mother.\n\nHusam, for his part, left behind a girlfriend. Saying goodbye, \"I gave her a kiss on the cheek,\" he admitted, after being prompted by his mother.\n\nMore from this section Teens, Booze and E-Scooters: A Rising Threat as Injuries Crowd ERs Director Barry Jenkins finds echoes from his past in new Lion King Brazil's Lula 'in perfect neurological condition' post-op - Turkish book -\n\nThe Hidir family was travelling to Idlib, 40 minutes by car from the border.\n\n\"It will be better than Turkey,\" said 12-year-old Leyla -- though she seemed unconvinced as she toted a large, well-worn black suitcase toward the border, her black hat pulled down over her ears.\n\nShe acknowledged she did not know what Syria would be like. When her family fled, she was six months old.\n\nHer two little sisters, who were wearing pink Crocs despite the winter cold, were born in Turkey.\n\nThey were making the trip without their toys and stuffed animals, which were left behind.\n\n\"Their father will bring them when he joins us in a few months, God willing,\" said their mother, Nada. \"For now, he's staying in Turkey to work.\"\n\nAsked what she had brought in her backpack, Leyla timidly answered: \"My Turkish book.\"\n\n\"And a Koran,\" added her mother.\n\nLeyla reads only \"a little\" Arabic, she said. She did not know when she would be able to return to school in Syria.\n\nOn her last day of classes in Istanbul on Wednesday, Leyla did not tell her friends she was leaving.\n\n\"I didn't want them to be sad, too,\" she said.\n\nrba/zub/jhb/rlp",

                    "body": "HUTCHMED to Receive Milestone Payment from Takeda following First European Reimbursement for FRUZAQLA\u00ae (fruquintinib)\n\n- US$10 million milestone payment to HUTCHMED follows first national reimbursement in Europe -\n\n- Follows June 2024 European approval of FRUZAQLA (fruquintinib), the first novel oral targeted therapy in the EU for metastatic colorectal cancer regardless of biomarker status in over a decade -\n\nHong Kong, Shanghai & Florham Park, NJ - Friday, December 13, 2024: HUTCHMED (China) Limited (\"HUTCHMED\") (Nasdaq/AIM:HCM; HKEX:13) today announces that it will receive a US$10 million milestone payment by its partner Takeda (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK). Takeda received a national reimbursement recommendation for FRUZAQLA (fruquintinib) for patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer (\"CRC\") in Spain in December 2024, the first national reimbursement recommendation in Europe. CRC is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in Europe.\n\nFRUZAQLA was approved by the European Commission (\"EC\") of the European Union (\"EU\") in June 2024. Takeda has the exclusive worldwide license to further develop, commercialize and manufacture fruquintinib outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.\n\n\"We are delighted for both our partner, Takeda, and patients in Spain who will now be able to receive reimbursement for this innovative treatment. This is an important step forward in improving patient access across Europe more broadly,\" said Dr Weiguo Su, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer of HUTCHMED. \"It also underscores our ongoing collaboration with Takeda and reinforces our shared commitment to addressing the needs of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.\"\n\nCRC is a cancer that starts in either the colon or rectum. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer/World Health Organization, CRC is the third most prevalent cancer worldwide, associated with more than 1.9 million new cases and 900,000 deaths in 2022. In Europe, CRC was the second most common cancer in 2022, with approximately 538,000 new cases and 248,000 deaths.[1] In the US, it is estimated that 153,000 patients will be diagnosed with CRC and 53,000 deaths from the disease will occur in 2024.[3] In Japan, CRC was the most common cancer, with an estimated 146,000 new cases and 60,000 deaths, in 2022. Although early-stage CRC can be surgically resected, metastatic CRC remains an area of high unmet need with poor outcomes and limited treatment options. Some patients with metastatic CRC may benefit from personalized therapeutic strategies based on molecular characteristics; however, most patients have tumors that do not harbor actionable mutations.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\nFruquintinib is a selective oral inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1, -2 and -3). VEGFR inhibitors play a pivotal role in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Fruquintinib was designed to have enhanced selectivity that limits off-target kinase activity, allowing for drug exposure that achieves sustained target inhibition and flexibility for potential use as part of a combination therapy.\n\nGlobal regulatory submissions are based on data from two large, randomized, controlled Phase III trials, the global, multi-regional FRESCO-2 trial and the FRESCO trial conducted in China, showing consistent benefit among a total of 734 patients treated with fruquintinib. Safety profiles were consistent across trials. Results from the FRESCO-2 trial were published in The Lancet in June 2023, [9] while results from the FRESCO trial were published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA.[10]\n\nIn mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, fruquintinib is co-marketed by HUTCHMED and Eli Lilly and Company under the brand name ELUNATE. It was included in the China National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in January 2020. Since its launch in China, over 100,000 patients with colorectal cancer have been treated with fruquintinib.\n\nHUTCHMED (Nasdaq/AIM:HCM; HKEX:13) is an innovative, commercial\u2011stage, biopharmaceutical company. It is committed to the discovery and global development and commercialization of targeted therapies and immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases. It has approximately 5,000 personnel across all its companies, at the center of which is a team of about 1,800 in oncology/immunology. Since inception it has focused on bringing cancer drug candidates from in\u2011house discovery to patients around the world, with its first three medicines marketed in China, the first of which is also approved in the US, Europe and Japan. For more information, please visit: www.hutch\u2011med.com or follow us on LinkedIn.\n\nPlease consult the FRUZAQLA (fruquintinib) Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) before prescribing.\n\nGuidance for use: FRUZAQLA should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of anticancer therapy. Patients should be given the package leaflet.\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\n\nSPECIAL POPULATIONS: Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment; Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. FRUZAQLA is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as FRUZAQLA has not been studied in this population; Elderly: No dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years or above; Pediatric population: There is no relevant use of FRUZAQLA in the pediatric population for the indication of metastatic colorectal cancer; Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in females: Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for at least 2 weeks following the last dose of FRUZAQLA; Pregnancy: There are no clinical data available on the use of FRUZAQLA in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, FRUZAQLA has the potential to cause fetal harm. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity, including fetal malformations. FRUZAQLA should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with FRUZAQLA. If FRUZAQLA is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while on treatment, the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus; Breast-feeding: The safe use of FRUZAQLA during breast-feeding has not been established. It is not known whether FRUZAQLA or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. There are no animal data on the excretion of FRUZAQLA in animal milk. A risk to the breastfeeding newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose; Fertility: There are no data on the effects of FRUZAQLA on human fertility. Results from animal studies indicate that FRUZAQLA may impair male and female fertility.\n\n\u00b7 Hypertension: Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients treated with FRUZAQLA. Pre-existing hypertension should be monitored and adequately controlled in accordance with standard medical practices before starting FRUZAQLA treatment.\n\nHypertension should be medically managed with antihypertensive medicinal products and adjustment of the FRUZAQLA dose, if necessary. FRUZAQLA should be permanently discontinued for hypertension that cannot be controlled with antihypertensive therapy or in patients with hypertensive crisis.\n\n\u00b7 Hemorrhagic events: Hemorrhagic events have been reported in patients treated with FRUZAQLA, including gastrointestinal (GI) tract events. Serious and sometimes fatal bleeding events have been reported in patients after treatment with FRUZAQLA.\n\nHematologic and coagulation profiles should be monitored in accordance with standard medical practices in patients at risk for bleeding, including those treated with anticoagulants or other concomitant medicinal products that increase the risk of bleeding. In the event of severe bleeding requiring immediate medical intervention, FRUZAQLA should be permanently discontinued.\n\n\u00b7 Gastrointestinal perforation: GI perforation events, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with FRUZAQLA.\n\nSymptoms of GI perforation should be periodically monitored during treatment with FRUZAQLA.\n\nFRUZAQLA should be permanently discontinued in patients developing GI perforation.\n\n\u00b7 Proteinuria: Proteinuria events have occurred in patients treated with FRUZAQLA.\n\nProteinuria should be monitored before initiation and during treatment with FRUZAQLA in accordance with standard medical practices. If urine dipstick proteinuria \u2265 2 g / 24 hours is detected, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary. FRUZAQLA should be permanently discontinued in patients developing nephrotic syndrome.\n\n\u00b7 Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES): PPES is the most frequently reported dermato-logical adverse reaction.\n\nIf Grade \u22652 skin reactions are detected, dose interruptions, adjustments, or discontinuation may be necessary.\n\n\u00b7 Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): PRES has been reported in 1 patient (0.1%) treated with FRUZAQLA in clinical studies. PRES is a rare neurologic disorder that can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, altered mental function, blindness, and other visual or neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In patients developing PRES, discontinuation of FRUZAQLA, along with control of hypertension and supportive medical management of other symptoms, are recommended.\n\n\u00b7 Impaired wound healing: Impaired wound healing has been reported in 1 patient (0.1%) treated with FRUZAQLA in clinical studies.\n\nPatients are recommended to withhold FRUZAQLA for at least 2 weeks prior to surgery. FRUZAQLA should not be resumed for at least 2 weeks after surgery, as clinically indicated when there is evidence of adequate wound healing.\n\n\u00b7 Arterial and venous thromboembolic events: It is recommended to avoid starting treatment with FRUZAQLA in patients with a history of thromboembolic events (including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) within the past 6 months or if they have a history of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack within the last 12 months. If arterial thrombosis is suspected, FRUZAQLA should be discontinued immediately.\n\nEffects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of FRUZAQLA\n\nCo-administration of FRUZAQLA with rifampicin (a strong CYP3A inducer) 600 mg once daily decreased FRUZAQLA AUC by 65% and decreased C by 12%. The concomitant use of FRUZAQLA with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers should be avoided.\n\nCo-administration of FRUZAQLA with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) 200 mg twice daily did not result in clinically meaningful changes in the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and C of FRUZAQLA. No dose adjustment of FRUZAQLA is needed during concomitant use with CYP3A inhibitors.\n\nCo-administration of FRUZAQLA with rabeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) 40 mg once daily did not result in clinically meaningful changes in the AUC of FRUZAQLA. No dose adjustment of FRUZAQLA is needed during concomitant use with gastric acid lowering agents.\n\nEffect of FRUZAQLA on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products\n\nMedicinal products that are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)\n\nCo-administration of a single dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg (a P-gp substrate) with a single dose of FRUZAQLA 5 mg decreased AUC of dabigatran by 9%. No dose adjustment is recommended for P-gp substrates during concomitant use with FRUZAQLA.\n\nMedicinal products that are substrates of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)\n\nCo-administration of a single 10 mg dose of rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate) with a single 5 mg dose of FRUZAQLA decreased AUC of rosuvastatin by 19%. No dose adjustment is recommended for BCRP substrates during concomitant use with FRUZAQLA.\n\nhttps://www.fruzaqla.com/sites/default/files/resources/fruzaqla-prescribing-information.pdf\n\nhttps://www.pmda.go.jp/PmdaSearch/iyakuDetail/ResultDataSetPDF/400256_42910H0M1028_1_01\n\nhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/fruzaqla-epar-product-information_en.pdf\n\nThis press release contains forward\u2011looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

                    "body": "IND vs AUS 3rd Test: India gear up for a crucial 3rd Test at Brisbane's Gabba, with rain threats looming over the Border-Gavaskar Trophy clash, as both teams aim for momentum and a lead in the series.\n\nIND vs AUS, 3rd Test Weather report: As India gears up to lock horns with Australia for the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Gabba from Saturday, the threat of rain playing a spoilsport looms large. The five-match Test series is currently leveled at 1-1, where the hosts made a brilliant comeback after losing the series opener but then won the second Test match in Adelaide in dominant fashion. Both teams will try to dominate each other but the weather conditions are expected to play a huge role in deciding the result of the much-awaited match.\n\nThe Rohit Sharma-led side is coming back to the same venue, where they scripted history in 2021 as they became the first team to have won a Test match at the Gabba after 33 years. They went on to win the match despite facing a few challenges, for instance, they were without the services of their star players Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah, R Ashwin, and Mohammed Shami. They will try to repeat the 2021 heroics since their hopes of qualifying for the WTC final are at stake and if rain does play spoilsport in this match then things will only become complicated for them.\n\nBrisbane has experienced sunny days right up to this upcoming Test match, but the weather forecast for Saturday, December 14 predicts thunderstorms. During the pre-match press conference, the Australia skipper acknowledged the possibility of the match getting interrupted by rain.\n\nAs per Accuweather.com, the temperature on Saturday would range around 27 degrees Celsius with high humidity. There is a 60% chance of rain playing a spoilsport with heavy thunderstorms in the first session. The match will start at 5:30 a.m. IST and will face rain interruptions on the first day.\n\nWith the Men in Blue gearing up to face a formidable Australian side and unpredictable weather conditions, the third Test match at the Gabba has become a must-win and the Pat Cummins-led side got a huge boost as their star fast bowler Josh Hazlewood came to the side after missing the pink ball Test owing to an injury.",

                    "body": "Explaining to marketers that artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way they execute marketing campaigns and how they interact with customers is an unnecessary endeavour. Pretty much every industry has either already widely adopted the technology, or is in the process of weaving it into its current technology stack.\n\nThe question we should endeavour to ask, though, is how marketers can make the most of AI, and what they should prepare for as 2025 is fast approaching.\n\nA significant area of interest is AI-generated content. It offers immense value both from an efficiency and customer engagement perspective, but also raises concerns: how much can we give to AI? What is the place of us humans, particularly marketers in the equation? How to ensure accuracy and an ethical use of AI?\n\nThese considerations will be crucial as marketing strategies and technology investments for 2025 take shape.\n\nWhat's Next in AI-Generated Content\n\nThanks to AI, we have really entered an era where content is king. Tools, driven by AI, not only enhance content creation but are also changing how content is delivered.\n\nThe last decade saw marketers focus on using data-driven technologies to improve personalisation. What we are now entering is an era of AI-driven hyper-personalisation, where customer experiences are tailored to individual preferences using vast amounts of data.\n\nBy harnessing AI, marketers can understand individual preferences, behaviours and context. They can recommend tailored products, predict customer needs and automate responses. Those seamless, hyper-personalised experiences are what will keep customers coming back and engaging more with their favourite brands.\n\nFour Ways AI Will Impact Content for Marketers\n\nGovernance and human oversight: three tips for a sustainable use of AI\n\nThe increasing use of AI demands greater responsibility. While AI tools can enhance user engagement and efficiency, careful governance and human oversight are crucial as the technology rapidly evolves.\n\n2025 has the potential to be an incredible year for marketers who understand the potential of AI, and how to use the technology effectively. However, they need to remember that AI is not a magic wand. It requires thoughtful planning, robust data infrastructure and ethical considerations.\n\nThis thought leadership is written by Jay Sanderson, Senior Product Marketing Manager at Progress",

                    "body": "To tackle the persistent traffic congestion in the Mundhwa-Magarpatta area, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has announced plans for a new underpass at the Kad Vasti junction. The underpass, which will be constructed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model, aims to improve traffic flow, particularly in areas like Jehangir Chowk, which often sees long traffic delays.\n\nEstimated to cost around Rs 67.3 crore, this underpass will be the second project of its kind in the Mundhwa area, following a similar proposal at Mundhwa Chowk, designed to offer better access to the Kharadi bypass. The move comes as part of PMC's ongoing efforts to address the rising vehicular traffic in this rapidly developing part of Pune.\n\nLocals Residents have expressed support for the proposal, noting that long-standing traffic issues have made daily commutes frustrating. Residents frequently experience long waits at traffic signals, especially at major junctions such as Mundhwa Chowk, Tadigutta Chowk, and Kad Vasti Chowk, which are heavily congested.\n\nAlso Read: Oppn Moves Impeachment Notice Against Allahabad HC Judge Over Controversial Remarks At VHP Event\n\nThe new underpass is expected to enhance traffic efficiency across Nagar Road, Mundhwa, Magarpatta, and Hadapsar, areas that have seen substantial residential and commercial growth. PMC officials anticipate that the underpass will significantly shorten travel times for commuters in these parts of the city.\n\nPlanned for construction at the Kad Vasti crossing, the underpass will stretch towards Magarpatta, just ahead of Tadigutta Chowk. The PMC is optimistic about collaborating with private developers for its construction, following the successful PPP model, and plans are being made to finance the project through a credit note-based system.\n\nAlso Read: Kolkata Man's Social Experiment To Turn Beggar For A Day Goes Viral; Netizens Share Mixed Reactions On How Much He Earns\n\nWhile many residents are excited about the infrastructure improvement, they also call for an enhanced public transport system in the area. The lack of reliable public transit options often forces people to rely on private vehicles, which only adds to the traffic burden.\n\nIn response to these concerns, the road department has indicated that plans to widen key roads in the area are already in motion. Some roads, such as the stretch from Tadigutta Chowk to North Main Road, are already being expanded in collaboration with Defence authorities, offering further hope for a smoother traffic flow in the future.",

Vivian Dsena is standing up for Karanveer Mehra.\n\nThe promo starts with Karanveer saying, \"Task pe dhyan dunga sirf mai. Trophy gayi tel lene. Ghutna (Knee) fate, Koni Jaaye (elbow) your responsibility. This is how I'll play!\" Sara says, \"Humko kyu bolra hai, tumahra sar phoote ya baal khiche!\" Listening Sara, Vivian says, \"Arey Sara Vo actor hai uske face par mat kariya!\" Sara then shouts to which Vivian expresses anger and says, \"Faltu chilla mat!\" In the next scene Karan says, \"Actors hai hum bhai! Aur kam time wale actor hai. 20 saal nahi hai mere paas!\"\n\nThis promo is receiving major appreciation for Vivian and people are guessing if they will be back as a team in the Bigg Boss 18 house.

Shoppers have flocked to retailers such as Boots, Sephora, SpaceNK and LookFantastic to purchase the iconic products, including the brand's renowned staple, the Bum Bum Cream.\n\nWhile the Sol de Janeiro Bum Bum Jet Set usually sells for \u00a330, new TopCashback members can snag the set for just \u00a310 for one day only. TopCashback is offering its new members a \u00a315 cashback bonus when they spend \u00a315 or more, plus 20% cashback on all Sephora purchases. Existing members can also benefit from 20% cashback on Sephora purchases for one day only. So, if you're already a TopCashback member, you'll pay \u00a324 after cashback - still a decent saving, reports the Mirror.\n\nWhether you're after skincare, makeup, or fragrances, Sephora has something for everyone, and you'll be saving while you shop. The Sol de Janeiro's Bum Bum Jet Set includes a travel-sized trio of their best-selling Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, Brazilian 4 Play Shower Cream-Gel, and Brazilian Crush Body Fragrance Mist.\n\nEach product in the lineup is infused with rich ingredients such as cupuacu butter, acai oil, and coconut oil, which ensure your skin remains soft, moisturised, and delightfully fragranced. It's an ideal option for stuffing stockings or just indulging yourself and makes for a lavish enhancement to any beauty repertoire.\n\nThe set has amassed over 6,000 reviews on Sephora, with eager customers proclaiming it their 'new favourite'. One satisfied customer commented: \"If you want to smell like summer, this is your go-to set. It's refreshing scent gives you the splash of a summer day. The added bonus of the shower gel and lotion leaves your skin feeling so soft!\"\n\nAnother enthused: \"I love the fragrance mist and always get comments when I use it.\" A third said: \"What's not to love? If you're already a fan, then this is a must-buy. Perfect travel-size products.\"\n\nHowever, not all feedback was glowing with one shopper saying: \"Don't get what all the hype is about. Overpriced body wash that does not foam well. Perfume is way to strong, the body butter is nice but way overpriced.\"\n\nFor those who aren't convinced by Bum Bum Cream, Sephora still offers a wealth of other tempting options, with the chance to save today through TopCashback.\n\nThe SUMMER FRIDAYS Lip Butter Balm 15g, typically priced at \u00a323, can be snagged for a mere \u00a34.17 by new TopCashback members after cashback, while existing members will pay \u00a319.17. Additionally, the Sephora Collection Ultimate Moisture Duo, retailing at \u00a325.49, will cost only \u00a36.24 for newcomers or \u00a321.24 for current customers.\n\nIf you're not convinced by Sephora but still on the hunt for beauty and skincare deals, why not pop over to Boots? They have an array of Star Gifts, discounted fragrances, and a selection of beauty sets perfect for Christmas. Alternatively, Cult Beauty is your one-stop shop for all skincare and gift requirements.",

A stunning 5-0 victory at Stockport propelled them to the top of the table, a position they consolidated with a flawless unbeaten month.\n\n\"At the start of the season Sky Bet expected Wycombe to be mid-table side, pricing them at 33/1 for the title and 9/1 for promotion. Fast forward 18 games and they've exceeded all expectations.\n\n\"Their odds reflect this incredible run of form: they are now 6/1 to win the title and odds-on at 5/6 to achieve promotion - an unbelievable achievement if they pull it off.\"",

                    "title": "Founder-led Companies: Are Stakeholders Set Up For Corporate Governance Failure? - Forbes India",
                    "body": "For instance, the high flying edtech giant Byju's is now battling a financial crisis. Byju's, founded by Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath in 2011, has been embroiled in financial irregularities and litigations from creditors, resulting in insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Lenders have sought repayment of the $1.2 billion loan the founders took in November 2021. Raveendran says the startup investors' darling, once valued at more than $20 billion, was now \"worth zero\".\n\n\"Accountability differs significantly; founders are often emotionally invested and more resilient in crises, while management-run firms may exhibit a stronger sense of fiduciary responsibility,\" says Anand Mohan Murthy, partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, Advocates and Attorneys.\n\nJoshi explains that startup founders know the worth of compliance, but the intensity of work and risk is so heavy that they may often forget the importance of compliance. Some of them might also be inexperienced, but intelligent enough to get advisors to understand the importance of compliance. \"But this again adds cost, which the startups may not be able to afford. Therefore, I think compliance is often ignored for one reason or the other in startups,\" he adds.\n\nIn the last few years Indian startups have grown in leaps and bounds with disruptive models and technologies. However, the pursuit of this hypergrowth in a short span of time brings a major risk of potential pitfalls associated with various factors such as expense manipulation, undisclosed related-party transactions, deviation from the identified business model and undisclosed liabilities.\n\nAccording to Vinod PV, partner, IndiaLaw LLP, founder-led companies often out-perform management-led companies due to the founder's commitment to the purpose of the company, obsession to achieve the purpose and willingness to take risks towards this objective. These traits result in more innovation, creativity and growth. \"However, founders often tend to compromise on governance while pushing for growth and profit,\" he adds.\n\nAlso read: 'Founder mode' or 'manager mode' for your startup? The devil may lie in the details\n\nRitesh Jain, co-founder, FlexiLoans, argues that it's ultimately about how governance is embedded into the DNA of the organisation. \"Both models have unique strengths,\" he adds. Founder-led companies excel in the early stages due to the \"founder's mentality\" -- a deep connection with the business, passion, and a bias for action that drives innovation and agility.\n\n\"However, as businesses scale, the introduction of seasoned management can streamline operations, establish systems and ensure consistency,\" Jain explains.\n\nJain says while a lack of experience can contribute to governance challenges, it's rarely the only factor. Startups operate in a fast-paced, resource-constrained environment, often navigating uncharted territory where governance lapses can arise unintentionally. It's also essential to note that governance issues are not unique to startups -- large corporations with decades of experience also face lapses. \"What sets founder-led startups apart is their willingness to learn and adapt,\" Jain says.\n\nAccording to EY, good corporate governance is based on founder mindset, investor mindset and board members. At the same time, a startup must create a culture where independent directors can speak openly and any red flag or word of caution by the auditors is acted upon. \"All stakeholders are equally important for a startup and founders must build efficient stakeholder management practices, be it sensibly thinking about diversity and inclusion, climate or even customer complaints for that matter,\" EY says.\n\nHowever, the issue is ridden with complexities. There are multiple instances of CEOs leaving their startups, some even when the companies are in trouble. Founders never abandon a sinking ship. Data compiled by Fintrackr showed that in the first eight months of 2023, nearly 20 startup CEOs left their positions to either join a new firm or continue in the same company in a different role. upGrad's CEO Arjun Mohan quit after a nearly-three-year stint joining Byju's to lead its international business. Mohan quit Byju's in seven months as it consolidated its businesses into three key divisions.\n\nSuhana Islam Murshedd, partner, Aquilaw, explains that management-run startups/new companies have diverse and experienced professionals to manage operations. \"Hence, management-led companies are sometimes more structured in terms of operations as well as the compliance framework,\" she adds.\n\nAt the same time, founder-led startups will often have the founder juggling multiple roles in operations, strategy and sales. In the initial stage, when the founders are trying to establish a business out of an idea, corporate governance and compliance may take a back seat. \"Companies that have better access to resources and are at a stable stage of business operations are generally more compliant and disciplined,\" she adds.\n\nVCs and investors often bring in a degree of accountability and transparency since they are themselves regulated and have a greater say in the management and company affairs, especially with respect to corporate governance. VCs are often wary of value destruction and understand that compliance and good corporate governance play a key role in ensuring value creation.\n\n\"Hence, VCs/investors are also interested stakeholders as they can assist in improving corporate governance levels in companies by incorporating mandatory obligations in terms of governance principles and monthly reporting obligations on the company through shareholder level agreements,\" says Murshedd.\n\nCorporate governance becomes all the more critical for companies that are IPO-ready or about to go public. A strong regulatory framework not only offers confidence to public investors but is also a sign of maturity of the founders. \"At a listing stage, the company has already reached a particular size and scale and therefore, issues of succession, transparency and cleanliness are more important and therefore a management-run company may get a better response in the public market,\" says Joshi.\n\nRaj Khosla, founder and MD, MyMoneyMantra, agrees that management-run companies are perceived well in an IPO process on account of their stability, governance and profitability which enthuse risk-averse institutional investors. \"However, founder-led companies can also perform well if the founder is seen as a visionary who drives growth in an evolving industry. Markets encourage founder-led companies that innovate, have a strong growth potential and a have clear path to profitability,\" he adds.\n\nOverall, apart from whistleblowers, institutional or proactive investors, Indian startups need to prepare a corporate governance framework.",

                    "body": "HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian shares fell on Friday, tracking Wall Street's decline in response to potentially discouraging data on the economy.\n\nU.S. futures and oil prices were little changed.\n\nChinese leaders wrapped up a two-day economic policy meeting in Beijing on Thursday. Investors were hoping for major moves to support the economy, but the readouts from the closed-door meetings of top leaders lacked details. State media reported that leaders agreed to increase government borrowing to finance more spending and to ease credit to encourage more investment and spending.\n\n\"Chinese authorities have been stuck in a more reactionary policy mode, as the uncertainty of U.S. tariff plans makes it difficult for policymakers to make any commitments just yet,\" Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a commentary.\n\nThe Hang Seng in Hong Kong dipped 1.7% to 20,057.69, and the Hang Seng Properties index lost 3%. The Shanghai Composite index lost 1.5% to 3,410.99.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 1.2% in morning trading to 39,360.43. A survey by the Bank of Japan showed that business sentiment among large Japanese manufacturers was stronger than expected in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.5% to 8,292.40. South Korea's Kospi added 0.6% to 2,497.61.\n\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.5% to 6,051.25, marking its fourth loss in the last six days. The index had been rallying toward one of its best years of the millennium.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5% to 43,914.12, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.7% to 19,902.84.\n\nA report said more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. A separate update, meanwhile, showed that inflation at the wholesale level, before it reaches U.S. consumers, was hotter last month than economists expected.\n\nNeither report rings warning bells, but they did dilute hopes that the Federal Reserve will keep cutting interest rates. That expectation has driven the S&P 500 to 57 all-time highs so far this year, driven by the fact that inflation has been slowing while the economy is solid enough to stay out of a recession.\n\nTraders are widely expecting the Fed will ease its main interest rate at its meeting next week. That would be a third straight cut by the Fed after it began lowering rates in September from a two-decade high. It's hoping to support a slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target.\n\nLower rates would give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation.\n\nA cut next week would have the Fed following other central banks. The European Central Bank cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Thursday, as many investors expected, and the Swiss National Bank cut its policy rate by a steeper half of a percentage point.\n\nFollowing its decision, Switzerland's central bank pointed to uncertainty about how U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's victory will affect economic policies, as well as about where politics in Europe is heading.\n\nTrump has talked up tariffs and other policies that could upend global trade. He rang the bell marking the start of trading at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday to chants of \"USA.\"\n\nIn other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 8 cents to $70.10 per barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 6 cents to $73.47 per barrel.\n\nThe U.S. dollar rose to 153.06 Japanese yen from 152.55 yen. The euro fell to $1.0462 from $1.0472.",

                    "body": "Uddhav Thackeray's Sena is gearing up for the upcoming civic body polls in Maharashtra and seems to be returning to its hard-core Hindutva ideology and politics.\n\nIn an indication that the Shiv Sena (UBT) would fight on its own in the upcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and civic body elections in other parts of Maharashtra, party leader Sanjay Raut said Friday the Maha Vikas Aghadi partners are yet to take a decision about contesting these polls together.\n\n\"So far, no civic or local body polls have been contested in an alliance... Even when there was an alliance of the Congress and the NCP and the Sena (undivided) and BJP. These are different kinds of polls and must be contested solo to strengthen the local cadre and then use that force in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections,\" Raut said.\n\nAfter the drubbing in the recently concluded Maharashtra Assembly elections, the Shiv Sena (UBT) is gearing up for the upcoming civic body polls and seems to be returning to its hard-core Hindutva ideology and politics. On Tuesday, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting of his party's former corporators in Mumbai, and asked them to focus on the civic body polls and spread the Hindutva ideology in every household in their area. During the meeting, some corporators also demanded that the Sena (UBT) should go solo in the civic polls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, after the meeting between Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar in Delhi led to speculation of the Senior Pawar patching up with his estranged nephew, Raut said that joining hands with Ajit Pawar would mean joining hands with the BJP. He said he knows Sharad Pawar well and that he will not to go away from the secular ideology.\n\n\"I don't think he will join hands with those newbies (Ajit Pawar and his faction) who have joined hands with the BJP... I have no doubts about it. But one thing should be noted... Who is mediating? It's Gautam Adani... All the political meetings in Maharashtra are taking place at the residence of Adani who is looting Maharashtra by taking the airports and other major establishments under his umbrella. He is trying to decide the future of Maharashtra... Those from Maharashtra who are attending these meetings should be ashamed of themselves,\" said Raut.\n\nThe statement also comes amid the reports of the NCP's Praful Patel and Sharad Pawar meeting a couple of days ago at Adani's residence.\n\nRaut alleged that Ajit Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party has been told to get five to six MLAs from the Sharad Pawar faction to get the ministerial berth in the Centre. \"The NCP led by Ajit Pawar has not got a Cabinet berth in the Centre as the NCP has not been able to fulfil the formula of six MPs for one cabinet berth... I have this information that the BJP has asked the NCP to get five to six MPs from Sharad Pawar's NCP so that his quota of 6 MPs would be completed and the NCP would get a Cabinet berth in the Centre,\" Raut claimed.\n\nWhy should you buy our Subscription?\n\nYou want to be the smartest in the room.\n\nYou want access to our award-winning journalism.\n\nYou don't want to be misled and misinformed.\n\nChoose your subscription package\n\nAll-Access\n\nDigital + E-paper subscription so that you don't miss anything.\n\nRs.4/day\n\nBUY NOW\n\nDigital-Only\n\nGet unlimited access to all our journalism online (minus epaper).\n\nRs.2.8/day\n\nBUY NOW",

Data privacy concerns, ethical usage of AI, and the need for human oversight are some of the key issues that marketers need to address when implementing AI technologies. Building trust with consumers and ensuring transparent communication about the use of AI are essential for maintaining brand reputation and loyalty. In conclusion, the rise of artificial intelligence in digital marketing signals a new era of innovation and transformation in the industry.

With the assurance that the traditional elders will find a way to recognize his accomplishments, Otumfuo urged the minister to continue working till the end of his term.\n\nThe only person in recent history to hold the position for two terms is Simon Osei Mensah, who was named Ashanti Regional Minister by President Akufo-Addo in 2017 and reappointed in 2021. Osei Mensah outlined his achievements at the same conference, including the start of 1,178 educational projects, more than 900 of which have been finished. In addition, he stated that 28 court buildings and 74 security service stations were being built, with 21 courts already finished.\n\nSimon Osei Mensah, a member of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), was elected to the fourth, fifth, and sixth parliaments of Ghana's Fourth Republic and was the Member of Parliament for the Bosomtwe seat from 2005 to 2017.",

It guided for a total technical result of 1.7 billion euros for its life-and-health reinsurance line.\n\nIts ERGO unit should bring in around 900 million euros in net profit from 22 billion euros in insurance revenue, Munich Re said.

And now, in a recent beta build, the Redmond tech giant is bringing a slight adjustment to Windows 11's Start menu to further comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nIn the recently released Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 27764 for Canary channel, folks in the insider community found that Microsoft is distinguishing between \"Windows\" and \"Web search from Bing\" in a side-by-side comparison. That seems like a minimal change, but it could mean a lot.\n\nHere's what it looks like, compared to an eagle-eyed Windows Insider (in German):\n\nUsually, when you search for something on Windows 11's Start menu, it shows up both searches from inside your computer and online. That web search is powered by Microsoft's search engine Bing, if you have it activated via Settings. And then, they show up as a result of \"Search the web\" right at the bottom below the \"Best match.\"\n\nLast year, Microsoft also said that it was allowing users to disable Bing web search, remove Microsoft Edge, and add custom web search providers like Google into the Windows Search interface to comply with the DMA. So, this change is one of them.\n\nSpeaking of the Build 27764 update, Microsoft also brings third-party passkey support and more.\n\nWe're also getting a change in the Start menu so when you right-click on apps pinned there, you will see jump lists for apps that have them. That, honestly, makes Windows 11 a bit more stuffed with things, and you can always disable that modern context menu in the Settings.",

Since then at least seven PPP members have publicly supported a vote to impeach him.\n\nOpposition parties, which control the single-chamber parliament, have introduced another impeachment bill and plan to hold a vote at 5pm (0800 GMT/4pm Malaysian time) tomorrow. They need at least eight PPP members to pass the bill with the two-third majority required.\n\nLee called on opposition members to \"join and vote yes for impeachment,\" saying \"history will remember and record your decision.\" A vote to impeach Yoon would send the case to the Constitutional Court, which has up to six months to decide whether to remove him from office or reinstate him.\n\nThere was more criticism of Yoon's defiant address yesterday, including his claim that a hack by North Korea last year may have compromised the computer system of the National Election Commission, without citing evidence.\n\nYoon cited as one reason for declaring martial law a refusal by the commission to cooperate fully in a systems inspection which meant the integrity of the parliamentary election held in April could not be assured.\n\nToday, the Secretary General of the commission, Kim Yong-bin, denied the possibility of election fraud, saying voting is entirely done by paper ballots and the courts have dismissed all 216 claims of irregularities raised as groundless.\n\nYoon is separately under criminal investigation for alleged insurrection over the martial law declaration. -- Reuters",

                    "body": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Economic Secretary Tulip Siddiq will open the hub in the market town of Darwen, Lancashire, on Friday following a community request after bank branch closures in the area.\n\nA banking hub is a shared space on the high street that can be used by customers of different banks.\n\nLike other hubs, the Darwen branch offers a counter service operated by the Post Office. Customers of major banks can carry out regular cash transactions from Monday to Friday.\n\nIt also offers a community banker service where customers can talk to their own bank about more complex issues on the day their bank is in the hub.\n\nCommunity bankers work on rotation, with a different bank available on each day of the week.\n\nDarwen's hub is located in the town centre, on Market Street.\n\nMs Reeves said: \"Reaching this milestone of 100 banking hubs is a huge step towards making sure that people across the country have access to essential face-to-face banking services.\n\n\"High streets are the beating heart of our communities but were neglected for too long under the previous government.\n\n\"We are revitalising our high streets with our target for 350 banking hubs, reforming business rates to make them fairer and clamping down on antisocial behaviour.\"\n\nThe Government has set a target to roll out 350 hubs by 2029, with 230 expected to be open by the end of next year.\n\nCash Access UK, a not-for-profit company set up to protect access to cash, said that alongside the 100th hub opening, 100 deposit services will be live by the end of the year.\n\nDeposit services allow small businesses to deposit and access cash either through deposit ATMs, where customers from different banks can bank notes, or enhanced post offices where there is a separate counter for banking customers.\n\nATM and cash access network Link carries out assessments to understand how the closure of a bank branch will affect access to cash for the community.\n\nCommunities can also ask to Link to carry out an assessment if they feel they need better access to cash.\n\nCash Access UK is owned and funded by 10 major banks to provide shared services to their customers.\n\nGareth Oakley, chief executive for Cash Access UK said: \"Thanks to the exceptional industry collaboration from the banks who support us, I'm delighted that in a such short space of time we have been able to successfully open 100 banking hubs as well as deliver 100 deposit services.\n\n\"It's been a particularly busy year, this week alone we have officially opened five hubs.\n\n\"Our hubs are proving extremely popular, which shows that access to cash and banking services remains vital for millions of individuals across the UK, despite more people choosing to bank and make payments digitally.\n\n\"We're delighted to have reached this latest milestone and will continue our work to bring more of these services to the communities that need them most.\"\n\nJohn Howells, chief executive at Link said: \"The network of 100 banking hubs is keeping cash alive in local communities and is key for those consumers not yet willing or able to use digital.\n\n\"To date, Link has recommended 176 banking hubs, including eight this week, alongside more than 100 deposit solutions. Link will protect access to cash for as long as people need it.\"\n\nNeil Brocklehurst, acting chief executive at the Post Office said: \"I am thrilled that, as a result of the hard work of our partners Cash Access UK, our own hub team colleagues and our postmasters who run the hubs, we have today officially opened the 100th banking hub.\n\n\"Together, we are on our way to meeting the Government's target to open 350 hubs by the end of the Parliament and I want to thank every postmaster and their teams for making the running of banking hubs possible.\"\n\nBetween five and six million adults are estimated to rely on cash in their day-to-day lives, according to those behind the initiative.\n\nThe process of opening a banking hub can take several months from start to finish as suitable properties need to be found.\n\nRecent analysis of data from Link indicated the UK has seen around one in 10 ATMs close over the past three years.\n\nAnd more than three in every five bank branches across the UK have closed their doors permanently since 2015, according to research from Which?.\n\nWhich? has said the impact on local communities can be devastating, with some of the most vulnerable members of society, such as those living with disabilities or on lower incomes, reliant on branches and either unable or unwilling to switch to digital banking.\n\nNew rules overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) came into effect in September, meaning banks need to give more consideration to a local community's cash needs before deciding to close a branch.\n\nSam Richardson, deputy editor of Which? Money, said: \"Thousands of branches have closed their doors in recent years, often leaving those reliant on their services in the lurch or having to travel long distances to access them.\n\n\"Banking hubs are likely to be the future of banking, replacing shuttered branches, and while it's encouraging to see this milestone passed their rollout remains too slow for consumers to feel their benefit.\n\n\"It's vital that the Government holds its commitment to opening 350 hubs in the next few years - and it should be prepared to revise that figure upwards if necessary.\"",

                    "body": "But now, Google says that user satisfaction was low, leading to a drop in traffic to hotel sites.\n\nIf you live in Europe, chances are you may have come across Google Search's new format when you're looking to book hotels or accommodation. It only shows you the basic blue links format and removes features like maps and hotel-specific details to comply with the EU's Digital Market Act (DMA).\n\nThat's similar to Google's early days. The \"blue links\" were previously tested in countries like Belgium, Estonia, and Germany. But now, in a recent update, Google says that European users hated it.\n\n\"People were measurably less satisfied with their search results and it took them longer to find hotels,\" says Google's legal director Oliver Bethell. He also mentions that traffic to hotels' sites dropped, losing more than 10% on average, and it affected lots of European hotels.\n\n\"More people also gave up and did not find what they were looking for,\" Bethell mentions further. It was so bad that Google has now decided to stop the test, and the Mountain View tech giant is now looking to talk with the European Commission to find a solution.\n\nThe EU's DMA, at its core, wants to eliminate Big Tech's dominance by preventing companies from favoring their own services over competitors. That sounds good on paper, especially since it grows competition in the market. Companies like Microsoft and Google, for example, no longer have a massive dominant power in the cloud sector.\n\nBut it still comes under scrutiny. Apple is recently getting a stick after its hotly-hyped Apple Intelligence is being held back from European users due to the DMA. So now, features that rely on AI, including those to improve Siri, will not be available in the EU at launch and are likely to be delayed until 2025 or even later.",

                    "body": "SINGAPORE: Newly crowned world chess king Gukesh Dommaraju said becoming a champion was a dream that was more than a decade in the making, as he underlined his ambition to strive for \"greatness\".\n\nGukesh was just seven when he watched compatriot Viswanathan Anand lose the world chess title in November 2013 to challenger Magnus Carlsen of Norway -- a match that fired up his dream to bring the crown back to India.\n\nEleven years later in Singapore on Thursday, the 18-year-old beat China's Ding Liren after a gruelling tournament of 14 match days to become the youngest undisputed world chess champion.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the match, Gukesh cited the 2013 game as a defining episode for his success.\n\n\"I was in the stands and I was looking inside the glass box (where the players were) and I thought it will be so cool to be inside one day,\" he said of the tournament in his hometown of Chennai.\n\n\"When Magnus won, I thought I really want to be the one to bring back the title to India. And this dream that I had more than 10 years ago has been the most important thing in my life so far,\" he added.\n\n\"I've been dreaming about... living this moment for like more than 10 years.\"\n\nAnd this is just the beginning, Gukesh said, underlining his plan to be more than a one-hit wonder.\n\nHe wants to stay at the top \"for the longest time possible\", to ultimately attain Carlsen's eminence as the highest rated chess player in history.\n\n- 'Mental toughness' -\n\nThe teenager said he felt the jitters in the opening game in Singapore on November 25 which his more experienced opponent won.\n\nBut as the tournament wore on, he gained more confidence, winning a total three matches, including the dramatic final game, and settling for a draw in nine.\n\nThursday's final match was already heading for a draw and most pundits and spectators at Singapore's Resorts World Sentosa were resigned to the tournament extending to rapid-fire tiebreaker games on Friday, which would have favoured Ding.\n\nThe Chinese grandmaster became world champion last year in similar fashion by beating Russia's Ian Nepomniachtchi in Kazakhstan in the quick-fire playoffs -- akin to a penalty shootout in football.\n\nBut the teenager tenaciously pressed on, forcing a blunder by Ding.\n\nGukesh admitted that it was \"humiliating\" losing the first game.\n\n\"No matter how you prepare for it, you come here as an 18-year-old and you lose the first game like the way I did... It was quite tough to handle that,\" he said.\n\nBut he chanced upon his idol Anand in the lift who told him he had 13 more games to go.\n\n\"It was a nice reminder... I needed some mental toughness at that point,\" he said.\n\n- 'Level of greatness' -\n\nFormer five-time world chess champion Anand was among the first to congratulate the young champion, along with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"It's a proud moment for chess, a proud moment for India... and for me, a very personal moment of pride,\" Anand said in a post on X.\n\nModi described Gukesh's feat as a \"remarkable accomplishment\" which he said was \"the result of his unparalleled talent, hard work and unwavering determination\".\n\nDing resigned after making an endgame blunder, and took home $1.15 million while Gukesh got $1.35 million of the $2.5 million prize fund.\n\nBut the teenager underlined that the world title crown was just part of a bigger dream.\n\n\"Becoming world champion does not mean I'm the best player in the world,\" said Gukesh.\n\n\"Obviously there's Magnus. So it's also a motivating factor that... there is someone at a very, very high level and someone that will keep me doing the right things, working hard and trying to reach the level of greatness that Magnus has achieved.\"",

                    "title": "Samsung teams up with Google, Qualcomm for XR comeback",
                    "body": "Samsung Electronics plans to launch its extended reality headset next year, developed in collaboration with US tech giants Google and Qualcomm Technologies. The launch is expected to intensify competition with Apple's Vision Pro and Meta's Quest.\n\nAt the \"XR Unlocked\" developer event on Thursday at Google's New York campus, Google introduced Android XR, a new operating system designed for extended reality devices. Samsung also unveiled its first device powered by Android XR -- headset codenamed \"Project Moohan,\" meaning \"infinity\" in Korean. Detailed specifications and pricing have not yet been disclosed.\n\nThe XR technology offers immersive experiences by enabling users to move between the real and virtual worlds, leveraging senses such as sight, sound and motion. It is anticipated to revolutionize areas like work, education, healthcare and entertainment, breaking the constraints of physical environments.\n\n\"XR has quickly shifted from a distant promise to a tangible reality. We believe it has the potential to unlock new and meaningful ways to interact with the world by truly resonating with your everyday lives, transcending physical boundaries,\" said Choi Won-joon, head of the Mobile eXperience Division's research and development at Samsung Electronics. \"We are excited to collaborate with Google to reshape the future of XR, taking our first step towards it with Project Moohan.\"\n\nChoi also stressed the scalability of the Android XR platform, which can be adapted to various form factors, supported by an expansive ecosystem and diverse content offerings aimed at enriching user experiences.\n\nWhile this is not Samsung's first foray into the XR market -- the company previously collaborated with Oculus in 2014 to release the Gear VR headset and partnered with Microsoft in 2017 to launch the Odyssey Windows PC VR headset -- both failed to gain enough market attention.\n\nFor the upcoming product, Samsung has leveraged its hardware expertise, Google's Android operating system, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 chipset. It also acquired US-based OLED microdisplay manufacturer eMagin last year to strengthen its XR capabilities.\n\nThe Android XR platform, co-developed by Samsung, Google and Qualcomm, incorporates multimodal AI, which allows users to interact seamlessly with external and virtual environments. Powered by Google's Gemini AI, it supports natural conversational interactions and personalized responses by understanding context and user intent.\n\nCurrently, the global XR market is dominated by Meta and Apple, though the sector has not yet achieved widespread consumer adoption. According to Counterpoint Research, global XR headset shipments declined by 19 percent on-year, mainly due to a lack of use cases beyond gaming.\n\nApple's Vision Pro, launched in February, faced a lackluster reception, selling fewer than 100,000 units per quarter, according to IDC. The device's high price tag of $3,499 targeted early adopters, though Apple is reportedly working on a more affordable model to be released next year.\n\nMeta, holding about half of the XR market, has found greater success with its Quest 3 headset, priced competitively at $499. In the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, over 2 million units were shipped, highlighting a significant price advantage over Apple's Vision Pro.\n\nSamsung's latest XR venture aligns with its long-term vision for growth. According to Growth Research, global shipments of VR and augmented reality devices exceeded 10 million units last year and are projected to surpass 30 million by 2027.\n\nMarket research firm Mordor Intelligence estimates the XR market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 34.9 percent, reaching $472.4 billion by 2029, up from $105.6 billion this year.\n\n\"Despite the challenging market conditions following the lukewarm reception of Apple's Vision Pro, both Apple and Samsung appear committed to exploring ways to expand AR experiences for consumers,\" said Nam Sang-wook, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade.\n\n\"With the market still in an early stage, it remains to be seen how Samsung plans to differentiate itself through innovation,\" said an industry source, who asked for anonymity.",

                    "body": "I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy policy\n\nA group of girls in Washington, DC, are ready for prom. Hair is perfectly blown out and braided. Outfits are a blur of lace, sequin and tulle. And, on the other side of a series of locked doors at a capital correctional facility, are their dates: their fathers, many of whom they've not seen since the day they went to prison.\n\nThis is a scene from Daughters, a gut-punch of a Netflix documentary that follows four girls and their imprisoned fathers as they prepare for a daddy-daughter dance. At the Sundance Film Festival in January, the film won two audience awards, and is widely tipped for an Oscar nomination in 2025. \"It's a refreshing story about Black girls and their resilience,\" says Angela Patton, the film's co-director.\n\nPatton runs Camp Diva Leadership Academy in Richmond, Virginia, a six week summer camp for Black girls designed to build sisterhood and self-esteem, along with a nonprofit called Girls for a Change. Her Date with Dad programme began in 2008, with girls and their fathers invited to attend an evening of food, dancing, comedy and activities to help them bond. The events are designed to look like any other prom-type affair: there is music, there are party dresses, plenty of unchoreographed dance moves. But, early on, it became clear that those with fathers behind bars felt left out. So some of the girls wrote to a state sheriff and asked to host one of the parties in jail. He said yes. \"These girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms,\" Patton says.\n\nFilmmaker Natalie Rae found out about Patton's work in 2012 and immediately approached her to make a documentary. \"I thought it was one of the most inspiring, powerful, examples of what could happen when young women lead and we listen to their voices,\" Rae says. \"They're fearless and they know how to use forgiveness, which is one of the hardest things as adults we tend to avoid.\"\n\nPatton and Rae began working on Daughters together in 2016. It took them three years to find the right girls for the film, before following them in preparation for their daddy-daughter dance in 2019, then catching up with them a year later in 2020 and then once again in 2022.\n\nToday, sat on a many-cushioned sofa of a London hotel suite, there's no mistaking that Patton and Rae mean business. They radiate a steely determination, something necessary to bring a story like Daughters to the fore - and make the notoriously fickle film industry pay attention. Rae, as all good documentary makers do, mostly observes, leaning back quietly in a sharp leather jacket. Patton, from behind her black, cat-eye reading glasses, doesn't break her gaze from my face as she lays out just how important the film is for thousands of families with fathers in prison.\n\nEach girl followed in Daughters handles her father's incarceration differently. Five-year-old Aubrey is top of her class in school, relentlessly optimistic and full of love for her dad, Keith: \"Everything I wanted to be, she is,\" her father says with admiration. Ten-year-old Santana, however, is furious with her father Mark for leaving her: \"I'm sick of crying because of the things you do,\" she tells him. Ja'Ana, 11, doesn't remember her father Frank's face because her mother bans her from visiting him in jail. Meanwhile, Raziah, 15, struggles with her mental health and is terrified at the idea that her father Alonzo won't see her graduate high school. \"It doesn't feel like home when he's not here,\" she says.\n\nIn order to attend the dance with their daughters, inmates must first complete a 10-week fatherhood coaching course. Many dads are worried about their hair, their dodgy dance moves and their lack of suit and tie - all problems Patton duly solves for them. But in one session captured in the film, she takes a different tack: hammering home just how important the dance is to their daughters. \"They want to be with you,\" she passionately reminds them. \"They want to count on you.\"\n\nIn the film, many inmates admit they initially intended to use the programme as a means to receive another visit in jail. Due to cost cutting, hundreds of US prisons have ceased in-person visiting hours and replaced face-to-face \"touch visits\" with phone and video calls, both of which you have to pay for. This means that for many poorer families, communication has been drastically reduced. Patton warns that the negative impact of digital-only visits are \"terrifying\", particularly for Black girls with Black fathers. \"[There's] harm on their mental health, their education,\" she tells me. \"The children are feeling guilty. There's a lot of shaming that goes into it... It can be devastating for the entire family. Everybody is figuring out how to stay strong.\"\n\nMany of Daughters' most emotional scenes occur when dads are reunited with their children. Raziah sobs as she nestles into her father's arms, as he strokes her hair to soothe her. Keith looks steadily into Aubrey's eyes and touches her tiny chin with his thumb. Ja'Ana's dad struggles to recognise her at all. \"We all agreed that we wouldn't talk to the families that day,\" says Rae. \"That was their day. Their moment.\"\n\nThe crimes that led to the inmates' imprisonments are never revealed on-screen in Daughters, Patton and Rae deciding that if it \"wasn't important to the girls\", then it wasn't important to them as filmmakers. It means we see the men as people first, fathers second - and criminals rarely, if at all. Specificities are sometimes powerfully absent. One inmate, named Leonard, is told at one point that his daughter hasn't turned up to dance, and we never find out why. \"He went through a moment of reflection like, 'I have to do better,'\" Patton recalls. \"And he is. He's out now. Reconnected with his daughter, had more children, got married, and started his own nonprofit. He took ownership. That's what I love.\"\n\nDaughters and dads spend the day of their dance taking photos on disposable cameras, teasing one another on whose muscles are bigger, doing arts and crafts, and, of course, dancing. \"I had too much fun, I'm going to cry myself to sleep,\" Aubrey tells Keith at the farewell. \"I don't want to let you go.\"\n\nBefore the fathers return to their cells, they hand their daughters corsages and make sincere promises to do better by them. While \"Before I Go\" by Frankie Beverly and Maze plays, Aubrey tells her dad through tears: \"I'll always be here for you... It's not 'goodbye', it's 'see you later'.\" He smiles at her premature wisdom before admitting to the camera later just how much the farewell actually hurt. He will stay in prison for another 10 years minimum.\n\nEven Rae's crew dissolved into sobs at these scenes. \"Our cinematographer [Michael \"Cambio\" Fernandez] looked at us at one point and said: 'I don't know if anything will be in focus, the iris is filled up with tears,'\" recalls Rae. \"We were all crying in his arms. It was a moment that overwhelmed everyone in the space. It was the most powerful event I've ever experienced... and it was in focus. Thank God.\"\n\nNinety-five per cent of imprisoned fathers who take part in Patton's Date with Dad programme never return to jail once they are freed. Such is the project's success that other prisons, including Miami's Federal Detention Center and the Omaha Correctional Center, have started their own father-daughter dances. Meanwhile, Camp Diva continues to host their annual daddy-daughter dance at the Richmond City Jail where the project began 16 years ago.\n\nThe programme's reputation for good precedes it: Patton and Rae never had to look for a location for Daughters - because the Washington, DC, prison where it eventually took place rang them at the right time, asking if they'd bring the project east. \"They understood that a collaboration would be great and it would look good for them,\" Patton says of convincing the facility to allow filming inside the jail. \"So, they were like, 'OK, let's get it.' I don't think any of us really knew where it would go, but we all knew that it needed to be something that was shared.\"\n\nWhen Patton and Rae catch up with Aubrey, Santana, Raziah and Ja'Ana in the final scenes of Daughters, some are elated to have their fathers home, while others are disappointed. One father is still in prison, others are struggling to connect with their daughters on the outside. Both Rae and Patton point out, though, that although their documentary is about imprisoned men, all fathers could learn something from the film.\n\n\"So many daughters want a more emotional relationship with their dad,\" reflects Rae. \"This film is a reminder for fathers that if you're not there in person or you don't have a job, it's okay. Just be there [somehow]. Pick up the phone. Give us a hug. Ask us how our day was. We need you in so many ways. And maybe you don't realise just how special you are and what you can offer.\"",

Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, however, refused to even consider the possibility, and rightfully so.\n\nFor starters, the president believes that the youngster has what it takes to become a pillar of the club's future and can see the quality he possesses.\n\nFurther, the prospect of signing Muller does not excite the club simply because the player is already 35 years of age and the Merengues do not stand to gain much from the operation.\n\nGuler is loved in the dressing room and all his teammates and the management are well aware of what he can bring to the table in the years to come. There is thus no chance the president will accept any form of swap involving him.\n\nThe 19-year-old was a starter against Liverpool and Girona earlier in recent weeks and will only see more participation as the months go by. His goal against Girona, after all, showed what he is capable of.",

                    "body": "From delectable Parsi cuisine to authentic Maharashtrian flavours, these eateries in Pune cater to clientele with a fierce loyalty that has allowed them to build lasting legacies.\n\nWritten by Shubham Kurale,\n\nAt a time when fast-food restaurants are popping up in every corner of the city, a few eateries still stand tall, having managed to stay faithful to their patrons over generations. Among all the restaurants that have made their mark in Pune, very few can claim a legacy like these three.\n\nA taste of time: Dorabjee's legacy, since 1878\n\nIn the heart of Pune, nestled amid the bustling streets, lies a culinary gem that has stood the test of time - Dorabjee and Sons. Founded in 1878 by Sorabjee Dorabjee, this iconic eatery has been serving delectable Parsi cuisine for over a century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHailing from a humble farming family in Navsari, Gujarat, Sorabjee ventured to Pune with his brother Pestonjee, seeking a brighter future. Initially, he started by selling tea to tongawallahs, but the customer response soon led him to open a small eatery serving Parsi delicacies.\n\nOver the years, Dorabjee has become renowned for its signature dishes, including the aromatic mutton dum biryani, the tangy dansak dal, and the indulgent caramel custard among others. Today, Darius Dorabjee, who belongs to the fourth generation of the family here, runs the place. Despite the changing culinary landscape, the restaurant continues to thrive.\n\n\"We have always prioritised using natural ingredients and avoiding artificial additives,\" says Darius. \"This has resulted in a loyal customer base, especially among senior citizens who appreciate the gentle flavours and easy digestion. However, we are also witnessing a surge in younger diners, attracted by the unique flavours and heritage of our cuisine.\"\n\nMoreover, \"the secret to Dorabjee's enduring success lies in its loyal staff, quick service, consistent menu, and strong customer relationships,\" says Darius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the restaurant has embraced the digital age, embracing online food delivery platforms, it remains steadfast in its dedication to providing a memorable dining experience with its fifth generation now taking over the helm.\n\nLove for misal: Vaidya Uphar Gruha, since 1910\n\nA quaint eatery in Pune's Budhwar Peth, Vaidya Uphar Gruha is a time capsule that transports patrons to a bygone era.\n\nEstablished in 1910 by Raghunath Ramchandra Vaidya, a young man from Konkan, the eatery began as a modest restaurant. Over a century later, it continues to thrive with a contemporary twist.\n\n\"While the traditional clientele of local businessmen still frequents the place, a new wave of food enthusiasts, particularly youngsters, has discovered this hidden gem, thanks to the rise of food vlogging,\" says Deepak Joshi, its fourth-generation owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eatery's signature dish, misal, is a testament to its enduring popularity. \"Without any formal advertising, we serve over 1,000 plates of misal on weekends. People love our misal as it is made with green chillies, not the usual red ones,\" he explains.\n\nHowever, the eatery faces challenges in maintaining its legacy. \"Finding local staff who are skilled in preparing authentic Maharashtrian cuisine is becoming increasingly difficult. Non-local chefs may not have the same expertise,\" Joshi adds.\n\nAs for the future, he is uncertain. \"The younger generation isn't interested in carrying on the business. So, we will continue serving as long as the staff and I can.\"\n\nVaidya Uphar Gruha, a living relic of Pune's culinary history, stands as a reminder of the enduring appeal of traditional flavours and the challenges faced by heritage businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAuthentic Maharashtrian flavours: New Poona Boarding House, since 1925\n\nIn the heart of Pune's Sadashiv Peth, a stone's throw from SP College, stands a culinary landmark that has been serving authentic Maharashtrian cuisine for nearly a century.\n\nNew Poona Boarding House, established in 1925 by Gururaj Udpikar, fondly known as Maniyappa, began as a humble venture by a temple cook from Udupi, Karnataka. He travelled to Pune with dreams of a brighter future. Udpikar's vision was simple yet profound: to nourish students with authentic Maharashtrian cuisine. What started as a simple mess for students has transformed into a generational institution.\n\nThe eatery's hallmark is its traditional Maharashtrian thali, complete with special Sunday treats like crispy jalebi and the beloved puran poli. Third-generation owner Suhas Udpikar proudly maintains the restaurant's original ethos, emphasising its commitment to nutritious, home-cooked meals.\n\n\"Our strength lies in our loyal Konkani staff and unchanged menu,\" Suhas shares. \"We personally taste every dish daily to ensure consistent quality.\" The restaurant has become a favourite among civil services aspirants, offering a taste of home away from home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, challenges loom large. \"Parking and traffic issues have led many to prefer online food delivery platforms rather than visiting the spot, a trend that has surged post-Covid,\" Suhas notes.\n\nDespite these hurdles, as it enters its second century, New Poona Boarding House continues to be a testament to the enduring appeal of traditional Maharashtrian cuisine.\n\nWhy should you buy our Subscription?\n\nYou want to be the smartest in the room.\n\nYou want access to our award-winning journalism.\n\nYou don't want to be misled and misinformed.\n\nChoose your subscription package\n\nAll-Access\n\nDigital + E-paper subscription so that you don't miss anything.\n\nRs.4/day\n\nBUY NOW\n\nDigital-Only\n\nGet unlimited access to all our journalism online (minus epaper).\n\nRs.2.8/day\n\nBUY NOW\n\nClick here to join Express Pune WhatsApp channel and get a curated list of our stories",

Films for \"Raj Kapoor 100 - Celebrating the Centenary of the Greatest Showman\" - a grand showcase of 10 milestone Raj Kapoor films in 40 cities and 135 cinemas across the country that will keep his legacy alive and give audiences all over India an opportunity to revisit the films of an artist who lived for cinema and whose films gave voice to the common man.\"\n\nHe then shared that Raj Kapoor's 1951 film Awaara. The film stars Raj Kapoor along with his real-life father Prithviraj Kapoor, as well as Nargis, Leela Chitnis and K. N.

Talking about Rajji's incredible showmanship, the way he envisioned the dream sequence in the film had never been seen before,\" he wrote.\n\nThe thespian added: \"You are amazed by his fantastical imagination that visualized the surreal setting, the ethereal Nargisji emerging through thick clouds of smoke, Rajji surrounded by demonic figures and burning fires - there is a powerful, mystical symbolism in the dream sequence, and that is my favourite.\" Hema Malini Reveals Her First Film with Raj Kapoor at Age 16; Actress Says, 'I Didn't Know He Was a Legendary Figure'.\n\nTalking about Awaara, which was considered a milestone in the history of Bollywood, the story revolves around the intertwining lives of a poor thief Raj, the privileged Rita, and Judge Raghunath who is unaware that Raj is his son. In the film, Raj Kapoor's poor \"little tramp\" character references Charlie Chaplin and was further developed in other films such as Shree 420.",

Others brought forward activity.\n\nLast month, the BoE trimmed its annual growth forecast for 2024 to 1% from 1.25% but predicted a stronger 2025 with 1.5% growth, reflecting a short-term boost to the economy from the big-spending budget plans of finance minister Rachel Reeves.\n\nBritain's economic output has grown slowly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Only Germany, which was also hit hard by surging energy costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has done noticeably worse among the largest advanced economies.\n\nEarlier this month Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed that it was his ambition for Britain to have the fastest per capita growth in gross domestic product among the Group of Seven advanced economies.\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by Suban Abdulla and Sarah Young)",

More info\n\nAs the cold weather bites, Brits are scouring for thrifty methods to keep their homes cosy. A nifty trick, brought to light by TikTok sensation Sam Calver, following guidance from consumer champion Martin Lewis, might be the perfect solution for this winter's chill.\n\nIn a revealing clip, he explains a tip that he believes everyone should be aware of, noting the impressive impact it has had on his heating expenses. Sam divulged: \"I can't believe I've only just found out about this central heating trick. All I seem to be doing is turning the heating up all the time, but I saw Martin Lewis talking about the radiator foil hack, and I had to give it a go.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I grabbed myself some radiator savers - actually really cheap and you get about five metres of it. You just cut it to size, slide it down the back of your radiator, and it now reflects the heat from your radiator back into the room rather than seeping through your walls. It means you can have your heating on less and save a lot of money over time.\"\n\nThe video has struck a chord with many, racking up a heap of likes, with viewers also chiming in with their experiences.\n\nEchoing the sentiment, one commenter enthused: \"I done the whole room - walls, roof - even the windows. I honestly know how the Xmas turkey feels sitting in its tin foil all day. Very warm, but very dark,\" reports the Manchester Evening News.\n\nOne pleased individual shared their experience: \"It works well. Done it since the 80s. Also, put thick aluminium foil on the ceiling. The room becomes even warmer as you don't lose heat to the flat upstairs.\"\n\nSimilarly, another person chimed in: \"People have been doing this for donkeys years.\"\n\nThe savvy heating trick was pointed out by Martin Lewis during a 2022 episode of the Martin Lewis Money Show Live, where he suggested that putting foil behind radiators helps bounce back warmth into the room.\n\nAlthough one could opt for dedicated radiator foil, many residents find that common kitchen tin foil is a cost-effective alternative that performs comparably. Nonetheless, some specialists remain unconvinced about how efficient this practice really is.\n\nBut regardless of expert opinions, numerous internet influencers have backed the effectiveness of the strategy. In addition to the foil tip, Martin Lewis has offered other heating advice, such as applying cling film over single-glazed windows, which can act as insulation to keep the chill out and lessen the window's surface condensation between the warm interior air and cold glass.",

                    "body": "A small plane has crashed onto a motorway with witnesses reporting a \"huge fireball\" as the light aircraft smashes into the central reservation of a road in New York\n\nA small plane has crashed onto a busy motorway leaving at least one person dead. It is believed the plane barrelled into the central reservation in New York, US, sparking a major emergency response.\n\nDespite paramedics battling to save lives, it was confirmed that one of the two people aboard succumbed to their injuries. The other occupant is reportedly in serious condition.\n\nThe crash led to the spilling of aviation fuel and has resulted in the closure of Interstate 684 in both directions. The chilling incident unfolded in Harrison, about 25miles northeast from the heart of Manhattan, near 7pm US time (midnight in UK).\n\nREAD MORE: Plane passengers evacuated after engine goes up in flames during take-off\n\nREAD MORE: 583 people died in history's deadliest air crash due to 'tragic misunderstanding'\n\nGravely affected by the tragedy, New York Governor Kathy Hochul expressed her sorrow, stating: \"My heart goes out to the loved ones of those on board during this tragic incident, and I am praying for a safe recovery for the injured individual.\"\n\nA representative for the New York State Police delivered a bleak preliminary report: \"The preliminary investigation has determined there were two individuals on the plane, and one is confirmed deceased. Further information will be provided when it's available.\"\n\nThe specifics regarding the identities and genders of the duo caught in the accident are still under wraps, with officials keeping details confidential for now, reports the Mirror.\n\nThere's also no definitive word on whether any road users on the Interstate have sustained injuries. With the current situation, motorists are being advised to steer clear of the vicinity, adhering to any detours established.\n\nThis incident mirrors a tragic event that occurred in Derbyshire, UK, in September, where the pilot of a light aircraft lost his life after crashing into an industrial estate. The pilot sustained fatal injuries when their plane - an Evektor SportStar - veered off course and smashed into a building.\n\nThe Air Accident Investigation Bureau is currently probing this crash, which took place when the pilot was the sole occupant of the Evektor SportStar.",

                    "body": "A fisherman who raped and robbed a woman in the presence of her two children at Banana Inn, Accra, has been sentenced to 40 years imprisonment.\n\nCharged with robbery, Emmanuel Tetteh aka 666, Escoba, Commetey, pleaded not guilty before an Accra Circuit Court.\n\nThe Court, presided over by Isaac Addo at the end of the trial, found Tetteh guilty and sentenced him accordingly.\n\nTetteh is currently serving six years imprisonment for stealing money and a mobile phone. The phone, which had a tracking device, led to his arrest.\n\nThe trial judge in sentencing Tetteh considered the premeditated way the act was done.\n\nIt noted that at the point of robbing the victim, the accused had sexual intercourse with the victim in the presence of her two daughters, aged three and five years.\n\nAgain, the accused committed the offence while the instant case was pending at Circuit Court 10 in Accra.\n\nIt said with such a criminal mind, the accused did not deserve to live within society, and he must be kept away for a long time.\n\nProsecution led by Chief Inspector Jonas Lawer said looking at the antecedent of the accused, the severest of sentence should be passed on him.\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecution called two witnesses, while the accused called his wife as a defence witness.\n\nThe facts before the court were that the complainant's name withheld resides at Abolo Bridge, a suburb of Banana Inn, while the accused convict was a resident of Chorkor.\n\nOn June 23, 2022, at about 6am, the complainant came to the Police Station and reported that, the same day, she slept off on her sofa at the hall and woke up around 3am.\n\nProsecution said when the complainant woke up, she saw her sliding window together with the burglar proof on the main door opened.\n\nThe court heard that the complainant thought it was her daughter who had left them open, so she called her to come and close them only for the accused to come from her bedroom with a knife to her throat.\n\nProsecution said the accused asked her to keep quiet and lie down and hand over her Samsung Galaxy A12 mobile phone valued GHC900 which was beside her.\n\nAccording to prosecution, the accused person knelt beside her and fondled her. He asked her to lead him to where she kept her money.\n\nThe prosecution said the accused gave his orders to the complainant in Ga Language.\n\nThe prosecutor said the complainant's money was in her bedroom, so the accused followed her with the knife to the bedroom where he robbed her of cash in the sum of GHC2,090 together with another unspecified amount of money.\n\nAfter robbing her of the phone and money, accused had sex with the complainant after giving her a hefty slap when she declined.\n\n\"After raping her, he used the bed sheet beside her to clean his penis and bolted,\" the prosecution said.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, at the scene, it was observed that a similar modus operandi was used by the accused in other criminal adventures as captured in cases before the Adjabeng District Court Circuit Court 10 in Accra.\n\nProsecution on July 15, 2024, the complainant pointed out the accused in an identification parade.",

                    "body": "NAIROBI | Xinhua | Kenya's economy is stable and the government has laid a solid foundation for inclusive economic transformation, President William Ruto said on Thursday.\n\nRuto made the remarks while celebrating Independence Day, marking 61 years since Kenya gained independence from Britain on Dec. 12, 1963.\n\n\"We are no longer where we were a year ago, let alone two years ago. We have moved beyond pledges and commitments and are now making progress with our implementation strategies,\" he said during the celebrations held in Nairobi, Kenya's capital.\n\nThe president said that the cost of living has decreased and inflation is at its lowest level in 17 years.\n\nHe attributed this to government efforts to supply farm inputs, such as subsidized fertilizer, which have sustained agricultural production. He said that Kenya is on course to achieve a food surplus after averting perennial hunger crises for three consecutive seasons.\n\nRuto also noted that farmers in maize, tea, sugar, coffee, and dairy value chains have increased their income by cultivating additional land, resulting in higher yields.\n\n\"When we say that our farmers are producing more and better, it is a fact. And when we say that Kenyans registered under Taifa Care (health insurance) are receiving better services than before, it is a fact,\" he said.\n\nIn June, mass protests erupted across Kenya in opposition to a proposed financial bill that aimed to increase taxes on essential goods and services, including bread and mobile money transfers. The demonstrations resulted in dozens of deaths and prompted a government reshuffle.\n\nWhile addressing the public on Thursday, Ruto underlined the success of government efforts in addressing unemployment, healthcare, and food security, saying that they are delivering tangible results.\n\nIn regard to job creation, he said that 200,000 jobs have been created through affordable housing programs, while 243,000 Kenyans have secured international employment since September 2022.\n\n\"Our rejuvenated micro, small, and medium enterprises have created 840,000 jobs this year,\" he added.\n\nMoreover, Ruto said that special economic zones and export processing zones have attracted 80 companies in the past two years, generating 14,000 jobs.\n\nThe World Bank said Tuesday that Kenya's economy is projected to grow by 4.7 percent in 2024, a slight downgrade from the earlier forecast of five percent.\n\nThe global lender attributed the slower growth to various challenges faced during the year, including the adverse effects of flooding. It also noted that economic growth is expected to stabilize at 5.1 percent in the medium term. \u25a0",

                    "body": "It has been reported by Alejandro Alcaraz in SPORT that Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti is increasingly concerned about the team's full-back positions.\n\nThese roles hold immense importance for a club with ambitions to compete for every title, and the current situation is far from ideal.\n\nRight now, the Italian is facing significant challenges due to the unavailability of first-choice players and the inconsistent performances of others.\n\nTo begin with, Dani Carvajal's injury has left a notable void on the right side of the defence, while Ferland Mendy is struggling to regain his top form on the left.\n\nThis has forced Real Madrid to rely on alternative options, but these have yet to inspire complete confidence.\n\nCurrently, academy products Lucas Vazquez and Fran Garcia have been tasked with filling these gaps, but their performances are not at the level required for a team aiming to win trophies.\n\nVazquez, although highly valued for his versatility, is 33 years of age. He is more suited to playing a supportive role rather than being a regular starter in every match.\n\nOn the other hand, Garcia brings dynamism and attacking flair, making him a more attractive option than Mendy in offensive terms.\n\nHowever, Ancelotti has not given him enough opportunities to fully establish himself as the primary choice for the left-back position. As things stand, he is beginning to settle into the role and is showing promising signs of replacing Mendy effectively.\n\nReal Madrid are already planning for the future and reportedly have their sights set on signing Trent Alexander-Arnold and Alphonso Davies next summer.\n\nBoth players are seen as long-term solutions to the full-back issues and could potentially arrive as free agents. However, until then, Ancelotti must make do with his current options.\n\nThe replacements are doing their best, but their efforts are not quite at the level expected of a club with lofty aspirations.\n\nWith six crucial months of competition ahead, Ancelotti must trust his current players to perform, even though they are not the ideal choices for such demanding roles.",

During a Daybreak Hitz broadcast, Andy Dosty publicly showed his admiration and affection for Shatta Wale. During a talk with Prophet Nigel Gaisie, Andy said, \"I love Shatta Wale and we are good friends.\"\n\nAhead of the elections on December 7, prophet Nigel Gaisie had been on the show to discuss the favorable development in more detail. When Shatta Wale's name was up during the interview, Andy said, for the first time since the gesture of reconciliation, that their long-standing disagreement had ended. For the two individuals' admirers and followers, this conversation is a momentous occasion that portends a cooperative and peaceful future in Ghana's music business. Many Andy Dosty and Shatta Wale fans have already voiced their excitement for the dancehall behemoth to make an appearance on Daybreak Hitz.",

A listing of Singapore-based Quest Global may help it raise about $1 billion, the people said.\n\nA potential deal could value Quest Global at more than $5 billion, one of the people said, adding that the company may also redomicile to India.\n\nDeliberations are preliminary and details such as size and valuation could change, the people said.\n\nA representative for Carlyle declined to comment, while Quest Global didn't immediately respond to a request seeking comment.\n\nCarlyle agreed to acquire a significant minority stake in Quest in 2023 in a transaction that saw Bain Capital and Advent International exit the firm.\n\nIndia's IPO market has been busy this year, with $17.7 billion raised so far, putting it on the cusp of an annual record of $17.8 billion raised in 2021, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The strong economy has enticed global investors, while the billions of dollars funneled into domestic mutual funds every month have supported the equity markets even when foreigners were selling. Some of the country's startups that had established their headquarters in Singapore are now considering redomiciling to India amid the country's rapid growth.\n\nQuest Global, which has more than 20,000 employees, provides engineering services around the world in industries such as aerospace and defence, automotive, energy, tech, health care and semiconductors, according to its website. Its partners include global companies such as Nvidia Corp. and Sony Group Corp.",

More info\n\nSupporters using or selling 'dodgy' Fire Sticks to watch live Premier League matches have been served with a 'clear warning' to 'stop immediately'.\n\nA fresh caution highlights to enthusiasts relishing their dose of their cherished football squads via these fire sticks that they may contend with 'serious consequences'.\n\nIn the shadow of the festive season, efforts to attack and break down piracy operations have escalated with an abundant schedule of football fixtures luring device owners. Fans who persist in illicit activities risk facing criminal prosecution.\n\nAmidst a strenuous two-week clampdown, several individuals in the Midlands were greeted by an unexpected 'knock at the door', as well as cease-and-desist communications through the post. This strong-arm effort led by the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) alongside police officers zeroed in on 30 purveyors of illegitimate IPTV services, some located within the West Midlands, Staffordshire, and Derbyshire region.\n\nThe implementation of cease-and-desist orders is spinning into more than just alerts, Kieron Sharp, FACT's CEO, has insisted. He conveyed that these notices compose \"the first step toward holding offenders accountable\" and underscored that peddlers of unlicensed access to premier content - which is inclusive of movies, television programmes and live sport events - would face \"serious consequences\" should they disregard these directives.\n\nMr Sharp warned: \"We strongly advise anyone involved in these activities to stop immediately. If you're supplying or using illicit streaming devices or illegal IPTV subscriptions, take this as a clear warning: you are breaking the law and risk facing serious consequences. We will continue working with police to track down and shut down these illegal operations.\", reports Birmingham Live.\n\nThe crackdown on illegal Fire Stick use has targeted multiple areas across the UK.\n\nOwning a hacked or 'jailbroken' Fire Stick isn't illegal per se, but using it to stream content behind a paywall without paying is against the law.\n\nA man from Newport, aged 42, was apprehended for his alleged involvement in an illegitimate IPTV venture that involved selling these banned Fire Sticks.\n\nJonathan Edge, a 29 year old Liverpool resident, was handed a three-year and four-month prison sentence following a private prosecution by the Premier League under the Fraud Act for continually selling pirated devices even after receiving a cease-and-desist order from FACT.\n\nAn expert has voiced concerns over the additional dangers posed by illegally modified Fire Sticks, highlighting that they can grant cyber criminals access to personal data and potentially allow them to infiltrate home networks and surveil through cameras.\n\nGlobal Cybersecurity Advisor at ESET, Jake Moore, issued a stark warning to The Sun, saying: \"Although tempting, dodgy Fire Sticks loaded with unauthorised apps can pose unknown risks to those using them and the devices they are plugged in to. These devices have been known to be shipped with malware that is designed to steal your personal data or allow hackers to roam around your home network - or even take control of your webcams.\"",

                    "body": "Teenager Lily Murphy scored her first senior goal as Manchester City eased to victory against St Polten, but the win was overshadowed by Alex Greenwood being taken off on a stretcher.\n\nSecond-half goals for Murphy and Kerstin Casparij maintained City's 100% record in the Women's Champions League this season and keeps them top of Group D, three points ahead of defending champions Barcelona.\n\nThe hosts found plenty of joy down the left-hand channel as forward Murphy - making her first start in the absence of Khadija Shaw, who BBC Sport understands was left out as a precaution - attempted to make the most of her full first-team debut.\n\nThe 18-year-old should have scored after just five minutes when Mary Fowler played her in behind the backline, but the teenager's low shot was saved by the foot of Carina Schluter.\n\nLaura Blindkilde Brown, Yui Hasegawa and Jess Park repeatedly won the ball in midfield to keep the visitors under constant pressure, though City's momentum was halted when Greenwood appeared to injure her knee in a challenge with Melanie Brunnthaler.\n\nThe defender immediately called for medical attention and was taken off on a stretcher to a standing ovation.\n\nBoss Gareth Taylor said he didn't know the extent of Greenwood's injury but she would be a \"huge loss\".\n\n\"We will just have to assess, like with all the many other injuries we have got,\" he added. \"We have two games to get through [before the winter break], we will check in on Alex and see how she is but it takes a lot for Alex to come off.\"\n\nCity were playing without longer-term absentees like Vivianne Miedema, Lauren Hemp and Naomi Layzell, with Chloe Kelly and Shaw also missing out.\n\n\"We seem to be losing big players,\" Taylor added. \"Miedema, Lauren Hemp, Layzell, Bunny Shaw. If it's Alex it is going to make it really difficult for us.\n\n\"But the girls are good in that sense. The recovery levels are good and, hopefully now, once we get this break we have a little bit of time and don't miss these players for too long.\"\n\nSt Polten managed to gain some territory towards the end of the half, but they needed a superb goalline clearance from Chiara D'Angelo to deny what would have been a tap-in for Fowler.\n\nCity reasserted their dominance in the second half and took a deserved lead when Murphy - a childhood City fan - converted Aoba Fujino's teasing cross at the back post for her first goal for the club.\n\nFujino continued to wreak havoc down the right wing and provided a near-identical assist 11 minutes later, though this time Casparij was the scorer.\n\nMurphy could have scored her second of the evening but curled wide after racing into the box from the left flank.\n\nIn the night's other game in Group D, Barcelona defeated Hammarby in Stockholm.\n\nCity will win the group and receive seeding in the quarter-final draw so long as they do not lose to Barcelona next week by a scoreline greater than 2-0.\n\nAlthough City moved a step closer to their target of winning the group, it was a mixed evening for Taylor's side.\n\nGreenwood's injury did not look good at all. Replays showed her knee twisting as she stepped in to win the ball, and the 31-year-old immediately called for attention.\n\nNot only is she City's captain, but Greenwood is one of the best ball-playing central defenders in the world. Her ability to start attacks from the back is key to the way Taylor wants his side to play, and any long-term absence could have a serious impact on City's prospects in the Women's Super League and Champions League.\n\nIt wasn't all doom and gloom though. There were joyous scenes on and off the pitch when youngster Murphy scored her first goal for her childhood club on her first senior start.\n\n\"It's unreal,\" Murphy told BBC Sport afterwards. \"Sharing this moment with my family who were watching me in the stands, it's unreal.\"\n\nIt was a good night for City's other youngsters too, with Blindkilde Brown (21) playing the full 90 minutes, while Gracie Prior (20) and Codie Thomas (18) came off the bench.\n\nAnother positive was the performance of Fujino, whose two assists were the two real moments of quality City produced. With Lauren Hemp and Chloe Kelly both currently sidelined, the Japanese winger, 20, is hitting her stride just when City need her.\n\nAnd there was a first club goal too for Casparij, who could offer another attacking option for City.\n\n\"We've revealed the new Kerstin more recently,\" City boss Taylor told TNT Sports.\n\n\"We are trying to play to her strengths, playing her higher up the pitch. She is a very good crosser of the ball.\n\n\"I was surprised when I saw the goal going in. I was like, 'wow, what is she doing up there?'. She is making an impact on games now and that is what we knew she could do.\"",

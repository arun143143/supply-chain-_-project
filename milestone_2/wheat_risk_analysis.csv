In response to the request from the Afghan side, India will provide further material support in the first instance to the health sector and for the rehabilitation of refugees, it said.

The Misri-Muttaqi talks came two days after India""unequivocally"" condemned Pakistani air strikes in Afghanistan that killed dozens of civilians.

India has not yet recognised the Taliban set-up and has been pitching for the formation of a truly inclusive government in Kabul. New Delhi has also been insisting that Afghan soil must not be used for any terrorist activities against any country.

It is learnt that New Delhi remains concerned over the presence in Afghanistan of terror elements belonging to Pakistan-based terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).

The MEA said the two sides discussed various issues pertaining to bilateral relations as well as regional developments.

""The foreign secretary underlined India's historic friendship with the Afghan people and the strong people-to-people contacts between the two countries. In this context, he conveyed India's readiness to respond to the urgent developmental needs of the Afghan people,"" it said.

""In view of the current need for development activities, it was decided that India would consider engaging in development projects in the near future, in addition to the ongoing humanitarian assistance programme,"" it added.

India has been extending humanitarian aid to Afghanistan in the last few years.

India has so far sent several shipments including 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat, 300 tonnes of medicines, 27 tons of earthquake relief aid, 40,000 litres of pesticides, 100 million polio doses, 1.5 million doses of COVID vaccine, 11,000 units of hygiene kits for the drug de-addiction programme and 1.2 tons of stationery kits.

"""Rural grandpa"" in northwest China becomes tourism envoy","An elderly man, sometimes holding farming tools, walks along the ridges of the fields; at other times, he herds sheep slowly under peach trees in bloom; and occasionally, he stands amidst the vast desert and mountains, embodying the image of a general while narrating the history of the ancient Silk Road in northwest China...

""He really knows how to command the presence and energy,"" ""Thank you for promoting my hometown,"" ""I've watched this video at least 10 times"" - as Zhang Yifang scrolls through the comments on his phone, he reads each one carefully.

Figures played by ""Sanxi Grandpa"" Zhang Yifang in his short videos. (Photo from the culture, radio, television and tourism bureau of Gannan Tibetan autonomous prefecture)

Zhang, 68, hails from Qingsi village in Datong township, Yongdeng county, Lanzhou, northwest China's Gansu province.

As a child, Zhang was nicknamed ""Sanxiwa,"" which literally translates into triple joy child. These days, he's more commonly known as ""Sanxi Grandpa,"" meaning triple joy grandpa, which is also his ID on short video platforms.

Over the past four years, with support from the local cultural and tourism department, Zhang and his son Zhang Jianzong have filmed and produced over 100 short videos.

From rural fields and farmhouses to the vast deserts, grasslands, and the striking Danxia landform, he has filmed in many places with distinct northwest China characteristics, sharing the cultural stories and unique features of Gansu province. ""Sanxi Grandpa"" now has nearly 1.3 million followers on the short video platform.

During the 2024 Spring Festival, Zhang Yifang joined a local troupe of folk art show which features celebration of Chinese Spring Festival in multiple forms such as dragon dance, stilt walking, lion dance and other folk performances.

He released nearly 10 videos, with one of them receiving over 5.87 million likes and more than 1.01 million comments.

The folk art show performance has a long history, with participants sometimes exceeding 300, parading through streets, alleys, and fields.

From childhood to adulthood, Zhang Yifang has participated in the folk art show performances nearly every year. This deep-rooted passion for local performances has made him a natural in the world of short videos.

In the summer of 2021, Zhang Yifang's children and grandchildren returned to Qingsi village. Under the clear sky and gentle wind, he was always seen lying in a chair, fanning himself with a straw hat, or playing with his grandchildren in the golden wheat fields.

Zhang Jianzong, who works in the film and television industry, captured these moments on camera and edited them into a short video. Once posted, the video quickly garnered over 50,000 likes and nearly 4,000 shares.

Surprised by the positive response, the father and the son decided to make rural life the central theme of their short videos and continue filming.

""When I was young, our village only had one black-and-white television, and we would all crowd around to watch movies together,"" Zhang Yifang recalled. The scenes of martial arts heroes always fascinated him. ""It would be amazing to be a martial arts hero one day!""

Now, this dream has come to life in his short videos.

From an ordinary farmer to a martial arts hero or a general, as Zhang Yifang's roles change, so do his backgrounds, such as a rural courtyard, the Danxia landform of Yongdeng, a waterwheel park, deserts, and grasslands.

Taking advantage of the popular trends in short video content, Zhang Yifang changes outfits every few seconds, enriching the scenes and roles to promote his hometown.

From the poplar forests in Jiuquan to the endless grasslands of Gannan Tibetan autonomous prefecture, Zhang Yifang has traveled to over 10 cities and prefectures in Gansu, filming videos wherever he goes.

He and his son have also launched two popular video series: ""Sanxi Grandpa's martial arts journey"" and ""Sanxi Grandpa's food selection.""

The first series showcases local cultural and tourism resources by portraying different historical figures, while the second focuses on traditional Gansu cuisine - how to make Yongdeng rose cakes, why the roast meat in Jiayuguan tastes so good, and how to dry Dingxi wide noodles, among others. Dozens of Gansu's regional dishes have been featured in the videos.

According to Zhang Jianzong, these two video series have already amassed over 460 million views. Many other short video creators have joined in, each offering their own perspectives on telling the stories of the northwest China.

As his popularity grew, Zhang Yifang wanted to inspire his fellow villagers to create content alongside him. Encouraged by the father and the son, many villagers began to appear in the videos.

""By participating in the filming, we not only get to experience performing, but also have the chance to show others the rural life. The affection from viewers is also a recognition of our village's development,"" said Zhang Yifang's neighbor Lu Zizhen.

As rural revitalization is promoted comprehensively, Qingsi village now boasts wider roads, better internet connectivity, and more complete service facilities - features that frequently appear in the videos.

Thanks to land transfers, villagers now enjoy a steady income and ample free time, which has created a demand for more recreational activities. Currently, more than 30 villagers regularly participate in the filming of Zhang Yifang's videos.

In 2024, Yongdeng county launched 20 high-quality tourist routes and organized over 200 cultural and artistic events, including theme exhibitions, social education programs, and reading activities, which supported nearly 30 short video creators to promote their hometowns.

""We want to encourage the public to promote their hometowns in ways that resonate with them, further unlocking the cultural and tourism value,"" said Li Tingming, director of the Yongdeng county bureau of culture, sports, radio, television, and tourism.",2025-01-10,an elderly man sometimes holding farming tools walks along the ridges of the fields at other times he herds sheep slowly under

Flood-Hit Farmers In Malakand To Receive Free Seeds And Fertilizers: Registration Underway,"(MENAFN- Tribal News Network) The agricultural department in Malakand, a flood-affected area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has launched a registration drive to provide farmers with free seeds, fertilizers, and medicines. Officials have urged those impacted by the 2022 floods to register promptly with the department to take advantage of this initiative.

A Lifeline for Malakand Farmers

The devastating floods of 2022 destroyed millions of acres of agricultural land in Malakand. To aid recovery, the World Bank, in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank, has initiated a digital registration system to support farmers by providing seeds, fertilizers, and other essential agricultural resources.

According to Dr. Inamullah, District Director of the Agriculture Department, the target was to register 32,000 farmers. However, only 22,000 have been registered so far, leaving 10,000 farmers out of the process due to misconceptions about the initiative.

""Many farmers mistakenly believe this registration is for tax collection rather than providing subsidized agricultural inputs,"" Dr. Inamullah explained. ""We are trying to inform them that the registration is solely to facilitate free provision of seeds and medicines.""

He further added, ""We don't want farmers complaining later that they missed out on subsidies. This program is designed to raise awareness and encourage farmers to register through local government representatives to avoid missing these benefits.""

Research indicates that approximately 1.8 million hectares of land in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are cultivated annually, fulfilling only three months' worth of food requirements. The remaining nine months' supply comes from other provinces.

Farmers in Malakand, however, face significant challenges, including a disrupted irrigation system and water shortages. Without resolving these issues, achieving higher crop yields remains a distant goal.

Rab Nawaz, a wheat farmer, highlighted the pressing need for water infrastructure, saying, ""Farmers don't just need seeds, fertilizers, and medicines-we need water. Without proper irrigation systems and dams, our productivity cannot improve. Good seeds are of no use if water isn't available.""

Once registered, farmers are eligible for free seeds, medicines, fertilizers, and other facilities. However, there is growing demand from farmers for immediate distribution of these benefits to alleviate fears of being brought into the tax net.

Rehman Gul, another wheat farmer, emphasized, ""I request that the registered 22,000 farmers be provided subsidies without delay. Many are afraid this initiative may lead to tax impositions, and timely benefits would help dispel such fears.""

He added, ""Poverty is rampant in our region. While the administration is trying to assist farmers, registered farmers must receive these promised facilities as soon as possible.""

Agricultural experts highlight that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's food production lags behind neighboring countries. For instance, Pakistan's average wheat yield per acre in rain-fed areas is 16 maunds, compared to 26 maunds in irrigated zones. In contrast, India and Bangladesh achieve 36 and 37 maunds per acre, respectively.

Experts argue that increasing productivity to match neighboring countries could secure food supplies for up to six months and significantly reduce dependence on imports.

As the registration process continues, authorities aim to build trust among farmers and address the region's agricultural challenges, paving the way for a more sustainable and productive future.",2025-01-10,menafn tribal news network the agricultural department in malakand a floodaffected area of khyber pakhtunkhwa has launched a registration drive to provide farmers with free seeds fertilizers and medicines officials have urged those impacted by the 2022 floods to register promptly with the department to take advantage of this initiative a lifeline for malakand farmers the devastating floods of 2022 destroyed millions of acres of agricultural land in malakand to aid recovery the world bank in collaboration with the asian development bank has initiated a digital registration system to support farmers by providing seeds fertilizers and other essential agricultural resources according to dr inamullah district director of the agriculture department the target was to register 32000 farmers however only 22000 have been registered so far leaving 10000 farmers out of the process due to misconceptions about the initiative many farmers mistakenly believe this registration is for tax collection rather than providing subsidized agricultural inputs dr inamullah explained we are trying to inform them that the registration is solely to facilitate free provision of seeds and medicines also read the silent killer understanding the impact of biomass smoke he further added we dont want farmers complaining later that they missed out on subsidies this program is designed to raise awareness and encourage farmers to register through local government representatives to avoid missing these benefits research indicates that approximately 18 million hectares of land in khyber pakhtunkhwa are cultivated annually fulfilling only three months worth of food requirements the remaining nine months supply comes from other provinces farmers in malakand however face significant challenges including a disrupted irrigation system and water shortages without resolving these issues achieving higher crop yields remains a distant goal rab nawaz a wheat farmer highlighted the pressing need for water infrastructure saying farmers dont just need seeds fertilizers and medicineswe need water without proper irrigation systems and dams our productivity cannot improve good seeds are of no use if water isnt available once registered farmers are eligible for free seeds medicines fertilizers and other facilities however there is growing demand from farmers for immediate distribution of these benefits to alleviate fears of being brought into the tax net rehman gul another wheat farmer emphasized i request that the registered 22000 farmers be provided subsidies without delay many are afraid this initiative may lead to tax impositions and timely benefits would help dispel such fears he added poverty is rampant in our region while the administration is trying to assist farmers registered farmers must receive these promised facilities as soon as possible agricultural experts highlight that khyber pakhtunkhwas food production lags behind neighboring countries for instance pakistans average wheat yield per acre in rainfed areas is 16 maunds compared to 26 maunds in irrigated zones in contrast india and bangladesh achieve 36 and 37 maunds per acre respectively experts argue that increasing productivity to match neighboring countries could secure food supplies for up to six months and significantly reduce dependence on imports as the registration process continues authorities aim to build trust among farmers and address the regions agricultural challenges paving the way for a more sustainable and productive future,climate,0
GRAINS-Chicago soyoil hits five-week high on clean fuel tax credit...,"By Ella Cao and Mei Mei Chu

BEIJING, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Chicago soyoil futures rallied to a five-week peak on Friday and were on course for a 9.9% weekly jump, following expectations of President Joe Biden's administration releasing short-term guidance on clean fuel tax credits.

Soybean and corn prices rose and were headed for weekly gains as traders adjusted positions ahead of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) supply-and-demand reports, with weather concerns in South America continuing to impact prices.

Wheat prices slipped as traders struggled to find bullish drivers, with a stronger U.S. dollar adding pressure.

The most-active soybean oil contract for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) added 2.55% to 43.85 cents per pound, up for a fifth session to its highest since Dec. 6, 2024.

The rally was fuelled by talks that incentives for importing used cooking oil (UCO) would end and credits for soybeans would ease, traders said.

The tax credits, vital to Biden's sustainable aviation fuel goals, remain dormant due to a lack of U.S. Treasury guidance. Biofuel companies and supporters now await Donald Trump's stance on the upcoming guidelines.

Chicago soybean rose 0.08% at $10.00 a bushel by 0408 GMT. For the week, the contract has risen 0.8%, up for a third week.

Chicago corn gained 0.16% to $4.56-6/8 and was set for a 1.3% weekly rise - its seventh weekly gain in eight weeks.

Rains are needed to refresh Argentina's parched soy and corn crops, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange said. It is expected to rain within the next week after weeks of hot and dry weather.

Wheat fell 0.09% to $5.34 a bushel, but was set for a 0.8% weekly rise.

The dollar looked to extend its longest weekly winning streak in over a year, underpinned by rising bond yields and expectations of another strong set of U.S. jobs numbers.

Analysts expect U.S. wheat sales for the week ending Jan. 2 to range from 150,000-500,000 metric tons, corn from 700,000-1,400,000 tons and soybeans from 400,000-1,300,000 tons.

MoAL targets 30 percent rice self-sufficiency,"Bhutan has seen a decline in wetland areas used for paddy cultivation over the years

YK Poudel

The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MoAL) has earmarked Nu 1.279 billion in the 13th Plan to boost the country's rice self-sufficiency.

The initiative aims to raise the country's rice self-sufficiency ratio from 25 percent to 30 percent in the coming years.

The investment will target irrigation, land development, mechanisation, input subsidies, research, and support services to enhance rice production.

The ministry has outlined several key measures to boost rice production under the 13th Plan.

Officials confirmed that 26 major irrigation channels will be constructed, with five set for completion in the current fiscal year.

In addition, local governments plan to implement 118 small irrigation schemes this year to achieve a broader target of 700 schemes over the next five years.

""While Bhutan has seen a decline in wetland areas used for paddy cultivation, improved irrigation infrastructure has ensured steady gains in rice productivity,"" an MoAL official said.

Water management remains critical in rice farming, with an estimated 2,500 litres of water required to produce one kilogramme of rough rice.

To strengthen rice production, the ministry is collaborating with international organisations like the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to introduce improved rice varieties.

These varieties are considered among the more resistant to diseases and tailored to Bhutan's diverse agro-climatic conditions.

The government has also prioritised direct support for farmers through initiatives like price guarantee schemes, ensuring farmers receive fair prices for their produce.

State-owned enterprises such as the Farm Machinery Corporation Limited (FMCL) are contributing to commercial rice cultivation. In 2023, FMCL harvested 49 metric tonnes of rice from 91 acres of land.

A wetland validation exercise is also underway to protect vital paddy-growing areas, safeguarding these key agricultural lands for future generations.

Wetlands essential for rice cultivation will receive government support, while less critical areas may be repurposed for other crops.

The ministry is also exploring agro-tourism as a way to enhance rice farming.

By allowing tourists to experience traditional practices like transplanting, weeding, and harvesting, the ministry aims to promote farming while providing farmers with additional income.

The push for greater rice self-sufficiency is part of the government's broader effort to ensure food security.

While achieving 100 percent self-sufficiency in rice is unlikely due to various challenges, the government is plans to reduce import dependency by increasing domestic production.

Similar strategies are being applied to crops like maize and wheat, with initiatives such as irrigation, improved seed varieties, and financial support.",2025-01-10,bhutan has seen a decline in wetland areas used for paddy cultivation over the years yk poudel the ministry of agriculture and livestock moal has earmarked nu 1279 billion in the 13th plan to boost the countrys rice selfsufficiency the initiative aims to raise the countrys rice selfsufficiency ratio from 25 percent to 30 percent in the coming years the investment will target irrigation land development mechanisation input subsidies research and support services to enhance rice production the ministry has outlined several key measures to boost rice production under the 13th plan officials confirmed that 26 major irrigation channels will be constructed with five set for completion in the current fiscal year in addition local governments plan to implement 118 small irrigation schemes this year to achieve a broader target of 700 schemes over the next five years while bhutan has seen a decline in wetland areas used for paddy cultivation improved irrigation infrastructure has ensured steady gains in rice productivity an moal official said water management remains critical in rice farming with an estimated 2500 litres of water required to produce one kilogramme of rough rice to strengthen rice production the ministry is collaborating with international organisations like the international rice research institute irri to introduce improved rice varieties these varieties are considered among the more resistant to diseases and tailored to bhutans diverse agroclimatic conditions the government has also prioritised direct support for farmers through initiatives like price guarantee schemes ensuring farmers receive fair prices for their produce stateowned enterprises such as the farm machinery corporation limited fmcl are contributing to commercial rice cultivation in 2023 fmcl harvested 49 metric tonnes of rice from 91 acres of land a wetland validation exercise is also underway to protect vital paddygrowing areas safeguarding these key agricultural lands for future generations wetlands essential for rice cultivation will receive government support while less critical areas may be repurposed for other crops the ministry is also exploring agrotourism as a way to enhance rice farming by allowing tourists to experience traditional practices like transplanting weeding and harvesting the ministry aims to promote farming while providing farmers with additional income the push for greater rice selfsufficiency is part of the governments broader effort to ensure food security while achieving 100 percent selfsufficiency in rice is unlikely due to various challenges the government is plans to reduce import dependency by increasing domestic production similar strategies are being applied to crops like maize and wheat with initiatives such as irrigation improved seed varieties and financial support,climate,0
New Support for Women in Wheat Research - Seed World,"Funding package will underwrite training, mentoring and diversity initiatives.

A new initiative aimed at improving female representation in wheat research has secured funding from the UKRI Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). Led by the John Innes Centre (JIC), in collaboration with Rothamsted Research and The Sainsbury Laboratory (TSL), the project aims to achieve gender parity within the UK wheat community.

This 12-month project builds on the success of the Rosalind Franklin Women in Wheat Champions programme, spearheaded by Professor Diane Saunders at JIC, which was established to address the significant gender imbalance in wheat research within academia.

The new funding will allow this successful development programme to be expanded across organizations within the Delivering Sustainable Wheat (DSW) Strategic Programme, one of the largest coordinated wheat research initiatives in the UK.

""We have tremendous talent emerging in the next cohort of female wheat early career researchers and PhD students across multiple UK institutes and universities,"" Dr. Kim Hammond-Kosack, a research discovery fellow based at Rothamsted and leader of the Delivering Resistance element of the DSW programme, said in a press release. ""Now is the time to ensure we give this next generation the very best chance of career progression into senior positions and independence within wheat research. Giving voices to diversity is the only way to achieve real innovation in this sector.""

Female wheat researchers across the UK will gain digital access to career development training courses previously created by JIC/TSL, along with a highly successful one-on-one mentoring programme.

Additionally, they will have the opportunity to participate in professional leadership training and a specialized career development workshop in 2025. Senior wheat researchers will also undergo inclusive leadership training, aimed at addressing unconscious gender bias and helping them identify and tackle organizational barriers that may hinder female career advancement.

""I am proud that we are helping improve diversity and equality in science,"" Professor Graham Moore FRS, Director of the John Innes Centre, said in a press release. ""Working with our partners to support women in science, especially in fields like wheat research, is essential to solving critical challenges like food security and sustainable agriculture.

Rivers of Conflict: How the Russia-Ukraine War Is Reshaping Water Security,"Water has always been a vital source of life, development, and survival, serving as the elixir for human civilization. Yet, in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, water has become a weapon of destruction and a medium of conflict. Rivers have transformed into battlefields, and reservoirs have been attacked, turning a life-sustaining resource into an omen of death. Water has long been used strategically in warfare, either as a target for destruction or to cripple the enemy's capacity to inflict harm. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a prime example of how water resource management intertwines with military strategy. In Ukraine, especially in the eastern and southern regions, water is crucial not only for agricultural production and energy generation but also for meeting basic human needs. Large reservoirs, rivers like the Dnieper, and water bodies are vital for irrigation, cooling nuclear plants, and powering industries. Given their importance to military and civilian operations, controlling these resources has become a central objective in the ongoing war.

As the conflict escalated, military operations directly impacted Ukraine's water supply system. Airstrikes and military actions caused significant damage to water treatment plants, reservoirs, and pipelines, disrupting the distribution of clean water. For example, attacks on pipelines and pumping stations have caused severe shortages in various regions. The destruction of the Kakhovka Dam marked one of the most catastrophic events in the war. This vital structure, which regulated water flow along the Dnipro River, collapsed, leading to devastating flooding downstream. In Kherson, floodwaters surged to 5.68 meters, submerging residential areas and making it even more challenging to access potable water. The flooding also wreaked havoc on local ecosystems, carrying pollutants into the river and contaminating water supplies. Regions like Donetsk have seen river contamination, further endangering human health and aquatic life.

The humanitarian consequences of this destruction are immense. Over six million people in cities like Mykolayiv, Odesa, and Dnipro face daily challenges for obtaining clean water, and 1.4 million have no access to safe drinking water. In Mariupol, damage to about 40% of the water supply infrastructure forced residents to rely on overcrowded and unsafe alternatives, dramatically increasing the risk of waterborne diseases. The situation is dire, with health authorities warning of potential cholera outbreaks, adding further strain to already vulnerable health systems. Beyond the immediate health risks, the lack of potable water undermines the resilience of entire communities, making recovery from the conflict more difficult. It must be said however that in Mariupol and other cities of the Donbas region the situation has dramatically improved in the last year as massive reconstruction of infrastructure has been carried out at great speed.

Ukraine's agricultural sector, crucial to its economy, has also been severely disrupted. Water scarcity and contamination have hampered irrigation in critical farming regions such as Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, reducing crop yields. Ukraine is a major global wheat and sunflower oil supplier, so these water-related disruptions threaten global food security. The economic consequences of the water crisis extend beyond Ukraine's borders, worsening the global food shortages and raising concerns about long-term agricultural productivity in the region.

Meanwhile, the Caspian Sea is crucial to Russia's military operations. Its control facilitates naval movements and logistical support vital for the war in Ukraine. However, Russia's strategic use of the Caspian Sea has severe environmental and geopolitical consequences. Military activities along the Volga River have decreased water inflow to the Caspian Sea, jeopardising its fragile ecosystem. The decline in water flow threatens biodiversity and the livelihoods of communities that rely on fishing and agriculture.

Moreover, missile launches and naval exercises conducted in the Caspian Sea have introduced pollutants, further degrading water quality. This harms marine life and reduces the availability of clean water for both civilian and military use, with long-term repercussions for public health and ecological stability. Geopolitical tensions between Caspian littoral states complicate resource management, with disputes over control and environmental protection worsened by the war. This instance leads to water shortages and health risks for coastal communities.

As rivers have become battlegrounds and vital water infrastructure is destroyed, the humanitarian and ecological consequences of this war will last for generations. The impacts extend beyond Ukraine, jeopardising regional stability and global food security. The strategic, military, and humanitarian dimensions of water in this conflict make it clear that addressing water-related challenges is essential for immediate relief and long-term peace. Urgent international attention and coordinated efforts are needed to mitigate the environmental and humanitarian impacts of the war on water resources and ensure that water remains a source of life,

Zaytoon review:  A Middle Eastern takeaway still as good as when it opened 25 years ago,"Zaytoon opened the doors of its first branch in Parliament Street, Dublin, on January 19th, 2000.

The owners are Azad Shirazi, who worked as a chef in London in the 1980s, where he met an Irish woman, moved to Dublin in 1990, and got married; and Jamshid Kamvar, who studied engineering in Waterford in the late 1970s and later ran a Persian carpet shop on Dame Street, Dublin, where the pair met.

They had noticed that kebabs did not have the reputation they merited in Ireland and decided to introduce the Persian style of preparing and serving kebabs, with tandoor ovens for cooking their naan bread and meats marinated with saffron, fresh herbs and spices. An open plan kitchen was key to their approach, where diners could see their food being prepared and cooked. They now have five branches in Dublin. The fresh naan bread is made daily in their production facility and delivered to the branches to be cooked to order in the tandoors.

Stuffed peppers, lamb doner, classic Kubideh, and chicken shish.

Ordering online was easy, delivery was on time and the food was hot.

If you request your kebab as a plate, all elements arrive separately - the meat, the salad, the sauces and the naan bread, so that you can make up your own. The peppers were stuffed with a nice combination of rice, bulgur wheat, garlic, and fresh herbs, roasted in tomato sauce. This dish also happens to be vegan. The lamb doner - slices of Irish lamb marinated with parsley, tarragon, basil, smoked paprika, turmeric, and sumac - was juicy and tasty. The classic Kubideh, with minced beef and lamb, was good, flavoured with saffron, smoked paprika, turmeric, coriander, onions and garlic.

The chicken shish, flavoured with Iranian saffron, fresh lime juice and salt and pepper, was perhaps the least exciting of what we ordered.

"Adani Group to raise ₹7,148 crore from Adani Wilmar stake sale","The Adani Group will raise ₹7,148 crore from sale of up to 20% stake in FMCG firm Adani Wilmar in the open market as part of its strategy to exit non-core activities to focus on infrastructure business.

The conglomerate, which last month announced its exit from Adani Wilmar by selling the bulk of its stake to a joint venture partner, will sell 17.54 crore shares (13.50% equity) in the company on January 10 (to non-retail investors) and on January 13 (to retail investors) at a floor or minimum price of ₹275 apiece, according to a stock exchange filing by the company.

Adani Group to invest ₹7.5 lakh crore in Rajasthan across sectors

The Offer For Sale (OFS) will include an option to additionally sell up to 8.44 crore shares or 6.50% equity.

This is the first phase of the port-to-power conglomerate's exit from the joint venture in which it holds 43.94%. In the second phase, Singapore's Wilmar International Limted has agreed to acquire the residual stake at a price not exceeding ₹305 apiece.

On January 30, Adani announced its exit from the company which makes Fortune brand cooking oil, wheat flour and other food products.

Adani group loans: Indian lenders kick off a review

As per that announcement, Adani will sell up to 40.37 crore shares (31.06% stake) to Wilmar at no more than ₹305 apiece. The number of shares to be sold to Wilmar will depend on the response to the OFS.

In all, Adani hopes to get in excess of $2 billion (about ₹17,100 crore) from the exit. The transaction is expected to conclude before March 31, 2025.

Proceeds from the stake sale will be used to turbocharge the growth of Adani Enterprises Limited in core infrastructure businesses.

This is the first major transaction post the U.S. federal prosecutors in November filing an indictment against group executives over a $265 million bribery scheme to win renewable energy supply contracts. Adani group has denied the allegations as baseless and said it would seek legal recourse.

Explained | Decoding the OCCRP's Adani report

Adani Wilmar Limited is an equal joint venture between Adani Group and Singapore-based commodity trader Wilmar. The two partners currently own a combined 87.87% of Adani Wilmar, far above the maximum permissible 75%.

Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) rules mandate that large firms must have at least 25% of shares available to the public within three years from listing.

Established in 1999, Adani Wilmar makes Fortune brand cooking oil, wheat flour, pulses, rice and sugar. It owns 23 plants across 10 States.

The FMCG firm posted a consolidated total income of ₹51,555.24 crore during the last fiscal. Its market capitalisation on Monday (January 6, 2025) stood at nearly ₹42,000 crore (around $5 billion).

Adani Wilmar got listed on stock exchanges in February 2022 after raising ₹3,600 crore through an initial share sale.

Waldron and host Triton Central advanced last night in Shelby County Tournament girls basketball action, with the Mohawks (6-10) winning the first game, 63-24, over Southwestern (2-15), and the Tigers (10-6) defeating Morristown (8-7), 65-40.

A big Waldron third quarter, featuring five different players scoring field goals and six made free throws, added to the lead, with the final tally for the game at 63-24. Lindsey finished with 18, including four three-pointers, Corlett with 12, Kiley Best scored 9, Brooklyn Milbourn had 8 and Riley Thurston, 6. Southwestern was led by Tanna Tatlock's 17 points, including 11 free throws.

The second game started with staunch defense and few made shots. Morristown took an early 9-4 lead over Triton Central, but Quinn King's back-to-back buckets put the Tigers back in it, trailing by one, 9-8, at the end of the first. Triton Central then took control, hitting six three-pointers, including three from Maryrose Felling, two from Katherine Collier and one from King. Sophia Burbrink also added six points in the quarter, giving the Tigers a 36-17 halftime lead. The home team continued their strong play in the second half, with Felling adding 14 to the 9 she scored in the first half, giving her 23 for the game. Also leading the Tigers in scoring were Burbrink with 10, King and Sawyor Murdick with 9 and Katherine Collier, 8. Morristown was led by Nevaeh Sanders, who had 20 points.

Will USDA data dump spoil the bullish party for corn? - Braun,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a market analyst for Reuters.)

NAPERVILLE, Illinois - If anything can derail a price rally, it is a curveball from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Chicago corn futures have ticked slightly lower to start the year, but they had climbed nearly 12% in the final two months of 2024, an unusually strong late-year run.

Speculators now hold their most bullish corn view in two years, and luckily for them, the trade has already accepted that last year's U.S. corn yield was a whopper.

Friday will feature USDA's biggest data release of the year, with primary focus on the most recent U.S. corn and soybean harvests. U.S. quarterly stocks, U.S. winter wheat seedings and routine global supply and demand updates will also compete for attention.

U.S. CORN AND BEANS

On average, analysts peg U.S. corn yield at 182.7 bushels per acre, down from 183.1 in November. The trade estimate is more than 5 bushels above last year's record and above USDA's initial trendline yield for the first time in six years.

Bearish yield outcomes are less likely when the estimates are already large, and only four of 19 polled analysts see corn yield rising from November. However, the range of trade estimates (2.4 bpa) is smaller than usual, flagging the potential for surprise.

In the last decade, analysts anticipated the wrong direction of U.S. corn yield in January only once (2019). They did so three times for soybean yield (2016, 2019, 2022).

But bets are somewhat off for U.S. soybean yield outcomes because USDA's slashing of the forecast in November was the month's largest cut in 31 years. Trade estimates indicate some uncertainty around U.S. soybean production as the ranges for both yield and harvested area are historically wide.

Regardless, U.S. soybean supplies are expected to remain ample and at multi-year highs. However, USDA last month pegged 2024-25 U.S. corn ending stocks below the prior year's level for the first time.

If USDA cuts U.S. corn ending stocks on Friday as expected, it would be the agency's seventh consecutive monthly reduction. Such a streak has not been observed in at least two decades, reflective of the strong demand that has recently lifted corn prices.

From a market reaction standpoint, these demand dynamics could be somewhat insulating if the U.S. corn crop comes in larger than expected. The last two times CBOT corn had a distinctly negative reaction on January report day were 2012 and 2024, the latter sparked by a huge yield above all trade estimates.

U.S. WHEAT

USDA will not officially issue 2025-26 outlooks until May, but the wheat market will receive its first piece of 2025-26 U.S. crop intel on Friday with the winter wheat planting survey. Total U.S. winter wheat acres are pegged at 33.37 million, very close to both last year and the five-year average.

Analysts have had a rough time anticipating the planting survey in the last two years, coming in almost 1.4 million acres too high last year but lowballing by nearly 2.5 million acres in 2023.

Wheat traders have struggled to find viable bullish narratives despite wheat stocks among major exporters seen dropping to 17-year lows, so another big miss in the U.S. wheat acreage could either support or undermine the recent sentiment.

SOUTH AMERICA

The U.S. crops will probably dominate the headlines on Friday, but it is not too early to watch out for forecast changes in South America. Analysts see USDA upping Brazil's 2024-25 soybean harvest to a record 170.28 million metric tons from the previous 169 million.

USDA has increased Brazil's soy crop in three of the last eight Januarys, both on area and yield improvements, and many industry participants have already been factoring in a number north of 170 million tons.

For Argentina, there are already fears that ongoing dry weather could eventually warrant more significant cuts to soybean and corn crops than are anticipated for Friday. American and European weather model runs on Thursday remained stingy with the rainfall over the next two weeks.

USDA already hiked Argentina's soybean output last month on higher area. The agency increased the crop last January but reduced it in the prior three Januarys. Current crop conditions are slightly worse than a year ago but better than in the prior three years. Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters. Views expressed above are her own.

"South Alabama surges past Arkansas State 76-62, takes over sole possession of first place","It didn't come as easily as the previous three, but South Alabama rolled to its fourth straight Sun Belt Conference win and into sole possession of first place with a 76-62 victory over Arkansas State on Thursday night at the Mitchell Center.

Richie Riley's Jaguars (12-4, 4-0) shook off some early turnover woes to win their fifth straight game overall by double-digits, getting a season-high 22 points from Elijah Ormiston and holding the Red Wolves (11-5, 2-2) to 31% shooting. South Alabama has won its first four conference games for the first time since 2008, which happens to be the most-recent time it reached the NCAA tournament.

""What we've been preaching this whole season is 'chokeouts'; Riley's been talking a lot about that,"" Ormiston said. ""Our mentality is to come in every game, it doesn't matter who we play, it doesn't matter what their ranking is. We're just going to come out there and try to whoop their butt. And I was glad to be able to contribute to that.

""The beautiful thing about our team is, whether it's me, whether it's somebody else, we all love 'whooping' together. And every night's a different guy's night. Tonight happened to be mine.""

South Alabama, which came into Thursday leading the country in fewest turnovers per game (8.9), gave it away on their its four possessions and five times in the first 3-plus minutes vs. Arkansas State. Riley called timeout at that point to settle down his team, which was playing at home for the first time in 10 days and before a season-high crowd of 2,208.

What he told them worked, as Barry Dunning quickly scored seven of his 10 points to get the Jaguars back in the game. Three straight 3-pointers -- one by Cantia Rahming and two by Judah Brown -- gave South Alabama the lead for the first time, then consecutive 3s by John Broom and Ormiston put the Jaguars on top for good.

""I think we came out a little too juiced up,"" Riley said. ""I think a game like that, there's some buildup to it. We haven't had a game like that all year with this group where there was some buildup, there was some excitement, there was some people in the stands, a good crowd.

""And we came out just a little bit tight, pressing a little bit and made some mistakes. And I just wanted to settle them down. What I said in the huddle probably was not a 'settle-down' talk, but that was my intention of getting them over there, was to settle them down.""

Arkansas State pulled within five in the final minute of the half, but a four-point play by Ormiston -- a 3-pointer and a free throw after he was fouled on the shot -- with 0.3 seconds to go gave South Alabama a 41-31 lead at the break. The Jaguars never led by fewer than eight points in the second half, and were up by as many as 21 in the final four minutes.

The Red Wolves -- playing without preseason Sun Belt Player of the Year Kobe Julien for the fourth straight game -- tried to shoot themselves to victory, but were wildly unsuccessful. Arkansas State made just 12 of 49 3-point attempts and was only 21-for-67 from the field in the game.

Taryn Todd led Arkansas State with 18 points, while Joseph Pinion had 17 and Terrance Ford 12. Pinion had a team-high nine rebounds, but shot just 2-for-14 from 3-point range.

""The thing I know about our team is when we show up and we play the way we're capable of playing and do what we do on the defensive end, take care of the ball, and if we make some shots, I trust our dudes to play against anybody,"" Riley said. ""... Does that mean we're going to win every single game? No, it doesn't guarantee we're going to win, but it gives us a heck of a chance to be right there and have a chance to win.""

South Alabama shot 56.5% as a team, including 50% (12-for-24) from 3-point range. After the five early turnovers, the Jaguars gave the ball away just six times the remainder of the night.

In addition to Ormiston's season-best scoring output, the Jaguars got contributions from throughout the lineup on both ends. Brown and Myles Corey both scored 11, while Dunning and Broom had 10 each.

Broom led South Alabama with nine rebounds and three blocks, while Corey had six assists and JJ Wheat four. The Jaguars won the rebounding battle, 37-34.

""We play like 10 guys, 11 guys deep,"" Dunning said. ""That just shows the versatility that we have on the team and just shows togetherness. It doesn't matter who has the (big) game. Today, Elijah had a great game.

""... We're just a team and we're together and you can see the compassion, the love and the confidence that we have as a team. That showed today. That's how we got the (win). We've got to remain humble, steadfast and on to the next one.""

South Alabama came into the night tied with Troy for first place in the conference, but the Trojans lost 74-73 at home to Texas State to fall to 3-1 in league play.

"Courtney, Ravndahl expected to make Blazers' debuts on Friday","""I feel like I'm a hard-working, two-way forward, penalty kill[er], a little bit of a Swiss Army knife, can jump into any situation and kind of figure it out,"" Courtney told CFJC Today.

The Blazers are fighting to avoid missing the playoffs for a second consecutive season and expect Courtney will add grit, tenacity and experience for the remainder of the campaign.

Blazers' head coach and general manager Shaun Clouston said Courtney -- who is expected to begin his Kamloops tenure playing centre between Tommy Lafreniere and Jordan Keller -- has more offensive upside than his statistics this season (five goals and nine points in 31 games) suggest.

Clouston said Courtney accepted a role this season in Everett playing alongside younger players and his team-first attitude is appealing.

The Blazers parted ways with 20-year-old defenceman Layton Feist -- a move that made room for Courtney -- and he has cleared WHL waivers and joined the Mount Royal Cougars in the U Sports ranks.

Feist's departure left a hole on the blue line that was filled on Tuesday.

The Blazers acquired 19-year-old Rhett Ravndahl from the Brandon Wheat Kings in exchange for a fifth-round pick in the 2026 WHL Prospects Draft.

Clouston said it is a move made with experience and defensive soundness in mind.

World Food Commodity Prices Ease in December; Down on the Year,"World food commodity prices backed off in December, ending slightly lower on the year.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations on Friday reported that its food price index averaged 127 points last month. That was down 0.5% from November following three consecutive monthly increases, although still 6.7% higher than the same month a year earlier.

For 2024 as a whole, the overall food price index averaged 122 points, 2.1% lower than the previous year as major price declines for cereals and sugar offset smaller 'but not insignificant' gains in prices for vegetable oils, dairy and meats.

The FAO food price index tracks monthly changes in the international prices of a set of globally traded food commodities. The index hit its peak in March 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine (see graph below).

The cereal price index was relatively unchanged in December versus November, but 9.3% below its year-earlier level, as a marginal uptick in corn values offset a drop in in wheat. The cereal index averaged 113.5 points in 2024, down 13.3% from 2023 and marking the second annual decline from the 2022 record level.

The vegetable oil index eased 0.5% in December compared to a month earlier but was still roughly one-third higher than December 2023.

Foreign Secretary Misri Meets Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Muttaqi In Dubai,"Dubai- India on Wednesday said it would consider engaging in development projects in Afghanistan and provide material support to the country in the health sector as Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri held talks with the Taliban regime's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai.

It was the first publicly acknowledged engagement between the foreign secretary and a senior minister of the Taliban set up and it saw the Afghan side underlining its ""sensitivities"" to India's security concerns.

""Today, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had a meeting with the Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, in Dubai,"" the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement.

In response to the request from the Afghan side, India will provide further material support in the first instance to the health sector and for the rehabilitation of refugees, it said.

It was also agreed to promote the use of the Chabahar Port for supporting trade and commercial activities, including for the purpose of humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan, the MEA said.

The Misri-Muttaqi talks came two days after India ""unequivocally"" condemned Pakistani air strikes in Afghanistan that killed dozens of civilians.

India has not yet recognised the Taliban set-up and has been pitching for the formation of a truly inclusive government in Kabul. New Delhi has also been insisting that Afghan soil must not be used for any terrorist activities against any country.

It is learnt that New Delhi remains concerned over the presence in Afghanistan of terror elements belonging to Pakistan-based terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).

The MEA said the two sides discussed various issues pertaining to bilateral relations as well as regional developments.

""The foreign secretary underlined India's historic friendship with the Afghan people and the strong people-to-people contacts between the two countries. In this context, he conveyed India's readiness to respond to the urgent developmental needs of the Afghan people,"" it said.

""In view of the current need for development activities, it was decided that India would consider engaging in development projects in the near future, in addition to the ongoing humanitarian assistance programme,"" it added.

India has been extending humanitarian aid to Afghanistan in the last few years.

India has so far sent several shipments including 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat, 300 tonnes of medicines, 27 tons of earthquake relief aid, 40,000 litres of pesticides, 100 million polio doses, 1.5 million doses of COVID vaccine, 11,000 units of hygiene kits for the drug de-addiction programme and 1.2 tons of stationery kits.

The two sides also evaluated the ongoing Indian humanitarian assistance programmes, the MEA said.

Future-Proofing Wheat Breeding in Canada: Stay Tuned for our CrossRoads Panel Discussion,"the Alberta Seed Guide will host a panel discussion at the CrossRoads Crop Conference in Edmonton on the topic of Canada's wheat sector and how to future-proof it as Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's approach to plant breeding evolves and it looks to partner with others on field-ready cultivar development. Panelists will include:

We will be posting a podcast version of the panel discussion at this link. In the mean time, read our story on this topic from our Spring 2025 edition. For more information and to register for CrossRoads visit its website.

Canada's wheat industry is at a crossroads. For decades, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) has been the cornerstone of wheat breeding in Western Canada. In fact, many of the top-performing wheat varieties in virtually every class originate from AAFC programs, notes Rob Graf, science advisor for SeedNet and himself a former wheat breeder for AAFC who bred such game-changing varieties as AAC Wildfire.

During his years with AAFC, he witnessed firsthand a changing plant breeding landscape where government is gradually pulling back from field-ready cultivar development, and he says action is needed now to ensure a plan can be developed that will allow for a health future for wheat breeding.

""Without action, there's a real risk of falling behind global competitors.

"FBR to integrate FMCG manufacturers, wholesalers, and distributors into Digital Invoicing System  - Profit by Pakistan Today","Plan targets to connect approximately 10,000 FMCG entities with Digital Invoicing System to enhance tax monitoring, curb leakages

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is expanding its tax oversight by integrating Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) manufacturers, wholesalers, and distributors into the Digital Invoicing System (DIS). This initiative aims to strengthen sales tax monitoring and address substantial revenue leakages in the sector.

Under the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the FBR's Transformation Plan seeks to connect approximately 10,000 FMCG entities with the DIS across the country. The system will focus on manufacturers and wholesalers, bypassing the retail stage to target the most significant points of tax evasion in the value chain.

The FBR has identified key FMCG segments for the rollout, including wheat flour mills, beverage companies, food manufacturers, and bakeries. The goal is to ensure accurate tracking of sales and reduce the annual billions of rupees lost due to underreporting or evasion.

Currently, tier-1 retailers are linked with the Point of Sale (PoS) system, but its effectiveness in plugging leakages has been limited. In response, the FBR has overhauled the PoS mechanism for hotels and restaurants in Islamabad. A pilot project now incentivizes consumers to report fake receipts by offering prizes to complainants, thereby improving compliance.

The DIS initiative aims to digitize invoicing processes at key points in the supply chain to improve transparency and compliance. By connecting wholesalers and manufacturers, the system will provide real-time data on sales and tax collection, reducing opportunities for evasion.

The FBR also intends to phase out manual processes, making compliance easier for businesses while increasing tax revenues.

The project aligns with the government's broader strategy to digitize the economy and modernize tax administration. The FBR is actively engaging with industry stakeholders to ensure smooth implementation, including consultations on technical and logistical challenges.",2025-01-10,plan targets to connect approximately 10000 fmcg entities with digital invoicing system to enhance tax monitoring curb leakages the federal board of revenue fbr is expanding its tax oversight by integrating fast moving consumer goods fmcg manufacturers wholesalers and distributors into the digital invoicing system dis this initiative aims to strengthen sales tax monitoring and address substantial revenue leakages in the sector under the directives of prime minister shehbaz sharif the fbrs transformation plan seeks to connect approximately 10000 fmcg entities with the dis across the country the system will focus on manufacturers and wholesalers bypassing the retail stage to target the most significant points of tax evasion in the value chain the fbr has identified key fmcg segments for the rollout including wheat flour mills beverage companies food manufacturers and bakeries the goal is to ensure accurate tracking of sales and reduce the annual billions of rupees lost due to underreporting or evasion currently tier1 retailers are linked with the point of sale pos system but its effectiveness in plugging leakages has been limited in response the fbr has overhauled the pos mechanism for hotels and restaurants in islamabad a pilot project now incentivizes consumers to report fake receipts by offering prizes to complainants thereby improving compliance the dis initiative aims to digitize invoicing processes at key points in the supply chain to improve transparency and compliance by connecting wholesalers and manufacturers the system will provide realtime data on sales and tax collection reducing opportunities for evasion the fbr also intends to phase out manual processes making compliance easier for businesses while increasing tax revenues the project aligns with the governments broader strategy to digitize the economy and modernize tax administration the fbr is actively engaging with industry stakeholders to ensure smooth implementation including consultations on technical and logistical challenges,climate,0
Former CJI: Carb-rich diet major contributor of diabetes in India,"BENGALURU: India is moving away from its traditional, millet-based, soil-rooted diet to Western eating habits dominated by carb-rich foods. This shift is a major factor contributing to the growing prevalence of diabetes in the country, former chief justice of India DY Chandrachud said.

He was speaking on Thursday during the launch of Diabetes No More', a book by late Dr K Bhujang Shetty, Founder of Narayana Nethralaya, which delves into how diabetes is more of a dietary disease and not genetic inevitability.

The book, available in Kannada and English, aims to change the perspective that diabetes cannot be cured and highlights that the 'low carbohydrate diet' can reverse the disease. During the event, Justice Chandrachud shared the story of his father-in-law, whose health significantly improved after adopting a healthier diet, and highlighted how he himself changed his lifestyle by adopting a vegan diet.

He reflected on the interplay of environment and genetics in shaping human health, underlining that dietary habits and lifestyle choices hold the key to managing and even reversing diabetes. He praised Dr Shetty's personal journey of overcoming diabetes through disciplined dietary practices and called it an inspiring example of how individuals can take charge of their health.

The former CJI also stressed the need for a return to basics, advocating for a balanced lifestyle incorporating healthy diets, regular exercise, and stress management. He recounted personal anecdotes, including how dietary changes significantly improved his father-in-law's health, reducing his dependency on insulin from 20 to one dose per day.

He pointed out the growing neglect of traditional Indian foods like millets, which were once staples, in favour of rice and wheat -- foods perceived as symbols of affluence due to their association with Western lifestyles. This shift, he argued, has not only impacted individual health but also contributed to the loss of generational wisdom about nutrition and wellness.

During the event, the former CJI emphasised the impact of breastfeeding on long-term health, particularly in preventing conditions like diabetes, cholesterol, and asthma. He emphasised that breastfeeding goes beyond just nourishing the child. ""It is essential to create a society where breastfeeding is not stigmatised, but encouraged,"" he said.",2025-01-10,bengaluru india is moving away from its traditional milletbased soilrooted diet to western eating habits dominated by carbrich foods this shift is a major factor contributing to the growing prevalence of diabetes in the country former chief justice of india dy chandrachud said he was speaking on thursday during the launch of diabetes no more a book by late dr k bhujang shetty founder of narayana nethralaya which delves into how diabetes is more of a dietary disease and not genetic inevitability the book available in kannada and english aims to change the perspective that diabetes cannot be cured and highlights that the low carbohydrate diet can reverse the disease during the event justice chandrachud shared the story of his fatherinlaw whose health significantly improved after adopting a healthier diet and highlighted how he himself changed his lifestyle by adopting a vegan diet he reflected on the interplay of environment and genetics in shaping human health underlining that dietary habits and lifestyle choices hold the key to managing and even reversing diabetes he praised dr shettys personal journey of overcoming diabetes through disciplined dietary practices and called it an inspiring example of how individuals can take charge of their health the former cji also stressed the need for a return to basics advocating for a balanced lifestyle incorporating healthy diets regular exercise and stress management he recounted personal anecdotes including how dietary changes significantly improved his fatherinlaws health reducing his dependency on insulin from 20 to one dose per day he pointed out the growing neglect of traditional indian foods like millets which were once staples in favour of rice and wheat foods perceived as symbols of affluence due to their association with western lifestyles this shift he argued has not only impacted individual health but also contributed to the loss of generational wisdom about nutrition and wellness during the event the former cji emphasised the impact of breastfeeding on longterm health particularly in preventing conditions like diabetes cholesterol and asthma he emphasised that breastfeeding goes beyond just nourishing the child it is essential to create a society where breastfeeding is not stigmatised but encouraged he said,climate,0
The Friday Roundup - Backups and New Nvidia Graphics Cards,"Portable SSD NAS, UPS, Card Reader, RAID... Too good to be true?

If you are making videos these days on any sort of regular basis then you will be well aware of the fact that it doesn't take long before backup and storage becomes an issue.

I know from my own experience shooting exclusively in 4k that a One Terabyte backup drive is certainly not what it used to be!

Back in the day a terabyte was an unimaginable amount of data that only Nasa would possibly need.

Well those days are well and truly over so for me at least learning about backup and storage solutions has become my next learning curve.

Of course space for backing up your data is not the whole story with another important aspect being how secure that data is and whether you need redundancy built in as well.

There are a number of solutions available these days but before you can make an informed decision you first need to be informed!

So in light of that here's a slightly unusual take on it all.

In the video below from Matt Granger he reviews a very new system for backups which is all well and good.

The key part of this review is that as he is going over the device quite thoroughly he is also educating as to why you would need some features over others and under what circumstance you may decide on a particular solution.

NVIDIA RTX 50 Series: Built for Advanced Video Editing

The downsides to editing video at the consumer level pretty much comes down to one core issue.

You and I are mostly likely going to be using either a Smartphone or a lower level camera to capture footage.

By ""lower level"" I don't mean some kind of inferior quality device but a device that has been designed for consumer use as opposed to some kind of professional Hollywood setup.

The main thing that makes this possible is the existence of modern video codecs that allow for devices like these to capture high quality footage in a small form factor and at a price we can all afford.

Of course I am referring to the H.264 and H.265 video codecs.

The problem with these codecs is that they were exclusively designed for video capture and playback and absolutely no consideration was given to their functionality for editing.

As a result, editing this type of footage is hellishly demanding of computer resources and has been the driving force behind graphics cards packing greater and greater processing power over the years.

You can read a more detailed explanation about problems connected to editing highly compressed video files here: MPEG2, AVCHD and MP4 Editing Problems Explained

On the other side of things there has been another development that has come into play in our world and that is A.I.

This is yet another function that has appeared which demands enormous resources especially when it comes to the creation and manipulation of video.

Well this week those two worlds collided with an announcement by Nvidia of a range of graphics cards utilizing the latest technology driven by A.I. that will benefit video editing enormously.

It's gets a bit technical in parts but the article linked below is well worth a read to see where we are heading.

Tips on Editing a Project Containing Subtitles in PowerDirector

One of the main reasons you really need to get to know your video editing software inside out is best explained from the point of view of "" it has all gone wrong!""

What I mean by that is that when you are very deep into a project you will have a timeline loaded with all sorts of assets, effects applied and it is going to be very busy.

That's fine up until you realize there is a basic error in the project and correcting it will affect everything you already have sitting on that timeline.

That is when your knowledge of the program really comes into play and will determine whether you as a newbie are going to have to undo everything and start over or you as a pro are going to deal with it effectively.

Here's an example in PowerDirector where making a change will mess with the subtitles and how to deal with it.

How to Hack the New YouTube Algorithm in 11 MINUTES (and Get Views)

OK so the reality is that advice on achieving success with a YouTube Channel is pretty easy to come by.

However the accuracy of that information is the hard part!

I am not sure that there is any other subject that seems to be more prone to myths than this one.

It seems that everyone has at least one ""do this for YouTube success"" tip that sounds reasonable but in reality is worthless.

I find that it doesn't really take very much to analyse the various tips and tricks to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff.

Here's a video from the guys at Movavi on this exact subject and the reason I am posting it is this.

For every tip or piece of advice they logically step though and explain why this tip or that one is real or not based on what YouTube is trying to achieve rather than just someone's ""feelings"" about it.

Filming in National Parks is Allowed for YouTubers

Commercial filming in U.S. national parks was severely restricted if not outright banned some time around 2000.

The driving force at the time was that those areas needed some kind of protection from large scale movie productions.

The problems they were causing were that the resources were being exploited commercially yet nothing was going back to the parks themselves plus the general public were being inconvenienced in places that were supposed to be open to all.

Congress passed laws requiring the need for permits to be issued to try to gain some kind of control over the situation but over time that began to become a problem in itself.

The rise of ""YouTubers"" and small scale video production exposed questions as to what represented a commercial interest and exactly what constituted a ""large scale"" production.

A few lawsuits were launched challenging the validity of the laws and it was all a bit of a mess.

Well this week new laws were passed clarifying who can film in those parks and who needs a permit and you can see the details in the video below.

Solve Your LAG Issues! - DaVinci Resolve

Although you may initially need a slightly more powerful computer to actually use the free version of DaVinci Resolve, if you can the benefits keep rolling in!

Most video editing software these days offers a feature called ""Proxy Files"" or in the case of PowerDirector ""Shadow Files.""

The name is unimportant but the function itself can be a lifesaver.

Proxy files are lower resolution copies of the original files you import into a project with the advantage being that your computer has to do less work to manipulate these files.

This can become especially important if your computer is not a beast or if you are using 4K videos.

For example if you are using 4K Mp4 files the software allows you to create smaller Mp4 files at perhaps 1080p which takes some of the pressure off.

However at the end of the day you are still dealing with files that have been created using either the H.264 or H.265 codecs that were never intended for editing.

They are strictly designed for playback and as such are a handful to deal with for your computer.

So back to DaVinci Resolve!

In Resolve you can create proxy files but you can also dictate how those proxy files are created and using what codec.

DaVinci comes with a range of codecs you can use that are specifically designed for editing and thereby taking even more pressure off your system.

There's a lot of blah, blah around these days on the subject of A.I and its application within various video editing software solutions.

I keep quite a few programs on my computer because it helps me answer readers questions that they have and a lot of them are specific to a particular brand.

Because I have access to them and because I also edit a bunch of videos I am in a position to really look at those A.I. features to see how useful they actually are.

The truth is that while some of them are quite useful, a lot are great for marketing but in the day to day world of content creation, they don't really come into play.

Basically it's a lot of fluff with no substance.

One piece of software I do have that has A.I. tools in it that I use is DaVinci Resolve.

This is not really all that surprising because Resolve doesn't really have to prove itself to anyone and industry pro's are not going to be impressed by wizzbang features that really do nothing.

So for a realistic look at some A.I. tools that actually have a purpose here's some in Resolve.",2025-01-10,portable ssd nas ups card reader raid too good to be true if you are making videos these

Idaho Ag Record,"Idaho agriculture achieved record earnings during 2024, according to a new University of Idaho Extension economics report, though the gains weren't enjoyed by most food producers who raise crops.

Propelled by the strength of the livestock sector, Idaho farmgate cash receipts rose 4% from 2023 to all-time high levels of $11.3 billion, according to ""The Financial Condition of Idaho Agriculture: 2024"" by U of I agricultural economists Brett Wilder and Xiaoxue ""Rita"" Du.

Net farm income for the year rose 12% to $3.3 billion the second highest total ever.

Thanks to exceptional beef prices, Idaho ranchers earned $2.9 billion in revenue during 2024 from cattle and calves, which posted a third consecutive year of record revenue. Contrary to the national beef inventory, which has been contracting, Idaho grew its beef herd by 2% from 2023 to 2024, though the state's herd rebuilding may be slowed by the loss of range to wildfires last summer. Milk prices that were up 10% from 2023 contributed to milk revenues rising from $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion.

Revenue from other livestock including trout, sheep, goats, chickens and eggs was up by 12% at $321 million.

Feed prices, however, plummeted. Hay cash receipts during 2024 were estimated at $448 million, down 27%.

Furthermore, revenue from wheat dropped 7% to $564 million, and barley revenue dropped 5.5% to $398 million. Potato revenue dropped by 7% to $1.25 billion. Sugarbeet revenue rose by 1% to an all-time high of $470 million, though Amalgamated Sugar Co. reported that 18% of the crop had to be replanted, raising production costs for many growers.

Livestock represented 62% of the state's cash receipts in 2024.

Agribusiness is one of the state's major industries, responsible for one of every six dollars in sales in Idaho.

""Agriculture seems strong, but as a whole there are going to be winners and losers. It's going to be a pretty tough year for those in the crop sector,"" Wilder said. ""Only a few small sectors of the industry are actually doing well, and within those sectors it's only a few individuals legacy folks who aren't overleveraged and have economies of scale. Let's say you're a young hay farmer you had a bad 2024.""

Cold conditions bring cheer to wheat-growing farmers in dist - The Tribune,"While cold weather conditions may have impacted normal life in the city, it has certainly brought cheer to farmers in the district. Farmers say cold conditions are conducive for the growth of wheat plants.

While the region has been witnessing frost during the early morning hours for the last many days, the chill in the air remains throughout the day. However, wheat growers are not worried as they stated that the condition is good for tillering of the plants which would eventually lead to a good harvest.

Vegetable growers, however, are a little worried as the prevailing weather condition has stunted the growth of saplings and slowed the flowering process which would lead to a drop in harvest. The farmers are also making efforts to protect the small vegetable plants by covering them with tarpaulin sheets to protect them from direct harm caused by frost.

Tajinder Singh, Chief Agriculture Officer, said, ""With frost conditions, farmers do not have to worry about the wheat crop. They might have to take extra care of vegetables and fruit trees in case of frost.""

Lina travels with a fellowship of allies and goes on various quests. Though Lina's story is epic and there's plenty at stake in their world, the overall tone is more like a slapstick comedy.

5 The Vampire Dracula Declares War on Humans in Castlevania

Dracula Loses the Human Woman He Loved

Castlevania is inspired by the video game franchise of the same name. Dracula lives in a fictionalized version of Wallachia, just like the historical figure, Vlad Tepes, who inspired the folkloric figure. Medieval Wallachia had a very strong religious influence; the Church had a pivotal level of political power. This fantasy version of Eastern Europe has vampires, prophets, magic-wielders, and necromancers.

Castlevania also retains patriarchal and religious ideas about a woman's role in society. Dracula's beloved human wife, Lisa Tepes, disregards social and religious conventions when she studies medicine and practices as a doctor. Doctors were often targets of the Church, especially if their scientific practice second-guesses Church doctrine. Lisa is doubly at risk, because she is a woman. Dracula turns the might of vampiric hell on the Church and all the humans of Wallachia when clergymen accuse Lisa of witchcraft, then sentence her to death.

2 Guts' Fighting Skills Give Him Some Upward Mobility in Berserk

Griffith Dreams of Running a Kingdom In His Image

Close

Berserk is an incredibly dark high fantasy inspired by medieval England and France. The story draws from several elements of medieval history rather than just one historical figure or royal generation. Guts has a very rough life, as he grew up poor and orphaned. The only way he ensures any level of safety and security is through his fighting skills.

Upward mobility and security was a rare, if nonexistent, thing for a poor medieval peasant. Berserk has both historical and supernatural elements, as Guts, Griffith, and the Band of the Hawk intertwine with the workings of demons. Demonology was a large part of the medieval understanding, and Berserk juxtaposes the evils of humanity against spiritual evil, asking difficult questions about violence, greed, and choice versus fate.

The offer for sale (OFS) will include an option to sell an additional 84.4 million shares or 6.50 per cent equity.

This is the first phase of its exit from the port to power consortium joint venture, in which it holds a 43.94 per cent stake. In the second stage, Singapore-based Wilmar International Ltd has agreed to buy the remaining stake at over 305 rand.

On January 30, Adani announced his exit from the company, which makes Fortune brand cooking oil, wheat flour and other food products. As per that announcement, Adani offered 40.37 crore shares (31.06 per cent stake) to Wilmar, aggregating to not more than Rs 10,000 crore. The number of shares to be sold to Wilmar will depend on the response to the OFS. Adani expects to earn over US$2 billion (roughly Rs. 17,100 crores) from this exit.

The transaction is expected to be completed before March 31, 2025. The proceeds from the stake sale will be used to accelerate the growth of Adani Enterprises Ltd's core infrastructure business.

This is the first major transaction since US federal prosecutors accused the group's executives of a USD 265 million bribery scheme to secure renewable energy supply contracts in November. The Adani Group denied the allegations and said it would seek legal recourse.

Adani Wilmar Ltd is an equal-stake joint venture between the Adani Group and Singapore-based commodity trader Wilmar. The two partners currently hold a combined 87.87 per cent stake in Adani Wilmar, well above the maximum allowed 75 per cent.

According to market regulator Sebi's rules, large companies must make at least 25 per cent of their shares available to the public within three years of their listing. Adani Wilmar, founded in 1999, manufactures Fortune brand cooking oil, wheat flour, pulses, rice and sugar. It owns 23 industries in 10 states.

The FMCG company had reported a consolidated total income of Rs 51,555.24 crore in the previous fiscal. Its market capitalisation was around Rs 42,000 crore (about US$5 billion) on Monday.

From courtside to craft spirits - Food & Beverage Industry News,"Naught Distilling is a craft gin distillery based in Melbourne and founded in 2018 by professional basketball player Chris Cameron.

Known for its bold approach to gin-making, Naught Distilling combines modern distilling techniques with a passion for combining the best quality botanicals.

The distillery is also driven by a commitment to quality, creativity, and sustainability, producing small-batch gins that showcase diverse and distinctive flavours.

Since 2020, the company's flagship product, Naught Sangiovese Gin has earned acclaim from every major international awards competition, including International Wine and Spirits Comp in London, San Francisco World Spirits Comp, Singapore World Spirits Comp, New York World Spirits Comp, Global Gin Masters and the Australian Distilled Spirits Awards.

For Cameron, the journey to creating the company began on the basketball court.

""It all started because of my previous life as a professional basketball player,"" he said. ""Basketball not only fuelled my competitive spirit but also gave me the chance to travel the world.""

The sport taught him the value of hard work, as the rewards he received were directly tied to the effort he put in. However, after his playing days were over, Cameron transitioned into teaching, a profession he loved but always saw as a stepping stone.

It was during a trip to Melbourne that Cameron had an epiphany. While making beer at a local brewery, the idea of distilling spirits came to him.

""I thought, why is no one doing this for spirits?"" said Cameron.

This moment of realisation ignited a new passion. Armed with a 5-litre Italian copper still and a drive to learn, Cameron embarked on his distilling journey.

""I spent about three years learning the craft, completely self-taught, making plenty of mistakes along the way,"" he said.

But persistence paid off, and soon enough, he found himself producing a gin that he was proud to share.

The making of Naught Gin

Cameron's background in athletics has continued to help shape the brand's ethos.

""Discipline is definitely a big part of it,"" said Cameron.

""But what was even more important was the ability to stick with something.""

That persistence, or ""grit,"", became the cornerstone of his approach to distilling.

For Cameron, success was about outlasting the competition, whether in sports or business.

""The most successful people are the ones who can persist, even when the rewards don't come immediately,"" he said.

It wasn't just about hard work -- it was also about precision.

""It wasn't about creating something to fit a trend or something I thought others would love,"" he explains.

""It was about creating something I was truly proud of.""

This attention to detail became central to the Naught Distilling identity, particularly its balanced flavours.

""Anyone can make alcohol, but not everyone can make well-balanced spirits,"" said Cameron.

Naught Distilling has harmonious blends, where no single flavour dominates. Each ingredient, from botanicals to alcohol content, is calibrated to create a gin that is as refined as it is complex.

From passion to business

Though he never initially set out to turn distilling into a business, a pivotal moment changed everything for Cameron.

""A friend of mine reached out and said, 'Hey, I heard you're making gin. I'm keen to maybe go into business with you if you want to scale it up',"" he said.

This sparked the transition from hobby to enterprise.

Together, they mapped out a plan, sourced the right equipment, and began to carve out a brand identity.

""That's when it started to feel like it could be more than just a hobby,"" said Cameron.

""And that's how it started to evolve.""

The road wasn't without its challenges.

""We've made plenty of mistakes,"" said Cameron, recalling the early days.

""When we started in this industry, there were only a few Australian distilling trailblazers to look to. Most of the time we were learning as we went.""

Fortunately, Cameron had a key mentor in Cam Mackenzie, co-founder of Four Pillars, who offered advice and guidance on everything from local regulations to trade waste agreements.

""Cam's tips saved us both time and money,"" said Cameron

As the industry was still in its infancy, collaboration and mentorship were vital in helping Naught Distilling navigate the growing pains of a start-up.

A premium vision

One of the early decisions for Cameron and his team was where to position their product in the market.

""There are three segments: cheap, standard-priced, and premium,"" he said.

""We didn't want to be in the middle. We wanted to focus on premium gin.""

The aim was not just to create a high-quality product but to make it accessible.

""We wanted it to be aspirational, but attainable,"" said Cameron.

This approach informed everything from the gin's production to its distinctive packaging.

Every detail, including the bottle design, was intended to create a premium experience for both consumers and bartenders alike.

""We even based the bottle's diameter on the average span between the thumb and pinkie finger of the average female hand,"" Cameron revealed, adding that it was a small but thoughtful design choice to make the bottle easier to handle.

Unique botanicals and sustainability

What sets Naught Gin apart is its unique blend of botanicals, many sourced from across the globe.

While Australian ingredients are a key component, Cameron doesn't limit himself to local options.

""If the best ingredients come from another country, that's where I want them,"" he said.

The gin's balance and texture are key to its flavour profile. By using macadamia nuts and toasted watermelon seeds, Cameron has created a gin with a velvety mouthfeel and a long, warm finish.

Sustainability also plays a role in Naught Distilling's operations.

""We're very energy-intensive,"" said Cameron, given its electric-powered still.

This electric-powered 800-litre copper pot still has been affectionately named Abigail.

Abigail was custom built in Germany and remains the centrepiece of everything at Naught Distilling.

To mitigate environmental impact, the distillery has also implemented a closed-loop water chilling system to reduce water waste during distillation.

Cameron has also invested in solar power and is working to source botanicals ethically.

Naught's gins are made with pure wheat base spirit, and some of the botanicals used include juniper, citrus, wattle seed, and star anise.

Additionally, they're partnering with a company to improve their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy, with the goal of becoming B Corp certified, signifying a high standard of performance, accountability, and transparency across areas like supply chain practices, and materials.

Growing globally

Looking ahead, export remains a focus for Naught Distilling.

""In Australia, the market is relatively small compared to other parts of the world,"" said Cameron. ""We've decided that export is the way forward.""

Over the past year, the company has attended trade shows like the Bar Convent Berlin and Food & Hotel Asia in Singapore, forging partnerships in markets like Europe, North America, and Asia.

""It's not easy, but we're taking it one step at a time,"" Cameron said of their international expansion.

Local government support has also been instrumental in this growth.

""The Victorian government has been incredibly supportive,"" he said, highlighting how they've helped small distilleries with everything from equipment funding to exposure.

With backing from Global Victoria, Naught Distilling has been able to attend international trade events, connecting with key buyers and growing their brand on the global stage.

As the gin industry evolves, Cameron remains focused on quality.

While gin's popularity may be in decline worldwide, premium gin brands are seeing growth. New product development is driven by passion, not trends, he said.

""We make things for ourselves first, and if we're proud of it, then it can go to market,"" Cameron added.

The future is bright for Naught Gin, and Cameron's competitive drive shows no signs of slowing down.

""We want to be in the same conversation with the big players,"" he said.

With an international expansion strategy and a commitment to creating world-class gin, Naught Gin is poised to make its mark at home and abroad.",2025-01-10,naught distilling is a craft gin distillery

Euronext reiterates corn mycotoxin limits after rainy French harvest,"Financial markets operator Euronext issued a notice on Thursday reiterating limits on mycotoxins in corn delivered against its futures contract, after a rainy harvest in France, reported Reuters.

Mycotoxins are toxic substances produced by mould on crops, often in damp conditions, and can cause sickness when consumed by humans and animals. Corn is mostly used in livestock feed.

Euronext, whose corn (maize) futures are a price benchmark for the European market, said it was reminding participants that it applies maximum levels set out in European Union regulations, including a limit of eight parts per million for deoxynivalenol (DON), a common mycotoxin.

""Due to the corn quality in France this year, especially concerning the level of mycotoxins, Euronext has been receiving several questions over the past few weeks about the specifications in our corn contract,"" the group added in an emailed response to Reuters.

""The communication sent this morning acts as a reminder of the specifications, to avoid any misunderstandings.""

Physical delivery for corn traded on Euronext mainly takes place in France, with just one delivery silo available outside the country, at Ghent in neighbouring Belgium.

Corn quality in France, the European Union's biggest grain producer, has been a market concern after heavy rain hampered autumn harvesting and traders cited reports of increased presence of mycotoxins.

However, unlike wheat, for which French production slumped to its lowest since the 1980s, the country's corn output is estimated to have risen sharply with rain helping growth during summer.",2025-01-10,financial markets operator euronext issued a notice on thursday reiterating limits on mycotoxins in corn delivered against its futures contract after a rainy harvest in france reported reuters mycotoxins are toxic substances produced by mould on crops often in damp conditions and can cause sickness when consumed by humans and animals corn is mostly used in livestock feed euronext whose corn maize futures are a price benchmark for the european market said it was reminding participants that it applies maximum levels set out in european union regulations including a limit of eight parts per million for deoxynivalenol don a common mycotoxin due to the corn quality in france this year especially concerning the level of mycotoxins euronext has been receiving several questions over the past few weeks about the specifications in our corn contract the group added in an emailed response to reuters the communication sent this morning acts as a reminder of the specifications to avoid any misunderstandings physical delivery for corn traded on euronext mainly takes place in france with just one delivery silo available outside the country at ghent in neighbouring belgium corn quality in france the european unions biggest grain producer has been a market concern after heavy rain hampered autumn harvesting and traders cited reports of increased presence of mycotoxins however unlike wheat for which french production slumped to its lowest since the 1980s the countrys corn output is estimated to have risen sharply with rain helping growth during summer,climate,0
Crop switching boosts climate resilience in Chinese agriculture,"China's food production has nearly doubled since the 1980s, primarily driven by intensified nutrient application and expanded irrigation. With food demand projected to grow further, researchers Qi Guan and colleagues utilized a dynamic global vegetation model to analyze the nation's agricultural system under different 21st-century climate scenarios.

The team developed models aimed at maximizing crop yields while curbing nitrogen leaching and water consumption. These scenarios were designed to minimize supply chain disruptions and ensure long-term food security, even under varying climatic conditions.

Under optimal crop distribution scenarios, productivity could increase by 14.1%, nitrogen leaching decrease by 8.2%, and water use drop by 24.0%. Northern China's warming climate and increasing summer rainfall make it a promising area for rice cultivation. Shifting maize away from arid regions could significantly reduce water usage.

The study suggests that drought-resistant wheat could flourish in the Northeast China Plain, while soybeans may thrive in northern and northwestern regions as well as the Yangtze Plain. Water-intensive crops like potatoes could be better suited to eastern and southern China. According to the researchers, coordinated national efforts in crop switching could deliver substantial environmental and productivity gains.

Brandon makes minor deals at deadline,"The Brandon Wheat Kings traded a goalie and acquired another one on Thursday at the Western Hockey League trade deadline.

The Wheat Kings sent 19-year-old goalie Alex Garrett of Saskatoon to the Wenatchee Wild for a fifth-round pick in 2028, and then made a deal for the future, acquiring 17-year-old goalie Hudson Perry from the Edmonton Oil Kings for a conditional sixth-round pick in 2027.

The deadline, which was moved up a day from its traditional spot on Jan. 10 by WHL general managers, passed at 7 p.m. Brandon head coach and general manager Marty Murray said it's been a hectic week.

""It was really busy,"" Murray said. ""You talk to everybody. It's crazy how expensive everything is. It's tempting, but at the same time we engaged in conversations about some of those bigger fish on the market, and for us, losing a really good young prospect or multiple draft picks, is tempting but not a path we really want to explore and do detriment to this window we have as well as the future of our club.""

Garrett was acquired from the Everett Silvertips on Dec. 27 for a fifth-round pick in 2026. He was needed with starter Carson Bjarnason away with Team Canada at the world juniors, and backup Ethan Eskit nursing an upper-body injury he aggravated during the Christmas break.

""He came in and did an outstanding job for us in an emergency situation,"" Murray said of Garrett. ""He gave us a chance to win five games and we won four. Those are big points, and he created a conversation for sure about what we were going to do with our goaltending.""

Garrett appeared in five games with Brandon, posting a 4-1-0-0 record, a 2.40 goals-against average and a .917 save percentage.

Unfortunately for him, the number that mattered most was 2005. That's his birth year, which means he would be an overager next season trying to earn one of the three spots in a deep group that includes defenceman Quinn Mantei and forwards Nick Johnson, Matteo Michels and Dominik Petr.

""Eskit has had a real good first half of the season as well and he's a year younger,"" Murray said. ""When you throw Garrett into the equation age-wise, him being a 20 next year complicates things. If we have a 20-year-old goalie, then that removes another really good 20-year-old we can have who is in our room right now.""

Garrett will also get a chance to contend for the starting job in Wenatchee, while he would have been behind Bjarnason if he had stayed.

Perry, meanwhile, has split this season between the Oil Kings and the Alberta Junior Hockey League's Drayton Valley Thunder.

In four appearances in Edmonton, he posted a 6.20 goals-against average and .785 save percentage, while in the AJHL, he has a 3.26 goals-against average and a .913 save percentage in three appearances.

A product of Sexsmith, Alta., he went undrafted in 2022 but was listed out of Edmonton's training camp and signed with the club on Sept. 15, 2023. In 21 career appearances over two seasons, the six-foot-two, 161-pound goaltender has a 4-11-3-0 record, a 4.83 goals-against average and a .852 save percentage.

He is expected to stay in the AJHL unless one of Brandon's goalies is injured.

""That's a roster management thing a little bit,"" Murray said. ""We don't have an '07 (2007-born) goalie in our group. We're only going to have Eskit, as it stands right now, back for next year so it's an opportunity for him to come in and earn an opportunity ... We did it to protect ourselves and thinking about a worst-case scenario, whether it's injuries or what have you, it makes sense to have another junior-capable player in case we need to.""

Dylan McFadyen, 16, is the only other signed goalie in the organization.

In total, there were 11 deals made across the league on Thursday after many of the most highly sought after players were dealt earlier.

On Wednesday, the Spokane Chiefs emerged as a surprise buyer of 19-year-old forward Andrew Cristall from the Kelowna Rockets. The Chiefs, who haven't been aggressive on the trade front this season, sent 17-year-old forward Hayden Paupanekis of Winnipeg, a first-round pick in 2025, a third-round pick in 2025, a first-round pick in 2027, a second-round pick in 2026 and a sixth-round pick to the Rockets.

Kelowna is divesting top players as it builds up to host the 2026 Memorial Cup. Cristall, a prospect of the Washington Capitals, is second in the league in scoring with 60 points, which came from 26 goals and 34 assists in just 28 games.

The Rockets dealt 19-year-old defenceman Caden Price to the Lethbridge Hurricanes on Tuesday, and 19-year-old Czech defenceman Marek Rocak to the Swift Current Broncos on Wednesday.

The other major shoe to drop came when the Saskatoon Blades sent 19-year-old forward Ben Riche of Bethune, Sask., to the Prince George Cougars for 18-year-old forward Hunter Laing of Kelowna, the rights to 15-year-old defenceman Luke Dumas of Beaverlodge, Alta., a first-round pick in 2026 and a fifth-round pick in 2028.

Riche is having a career season, with 23 goals and 31 assists in 37 games. He will be joining his fourth WHL team.

While it would be nice as the head coach to go out and acquire a bunch of talent, Murray noted the general manager has to be a little more cautious. After all, it's a team that's internally considered to be good enough to contend for the next few years.

""We could have traded away all of our draft picks and built a heckuva team for three months and hope we get past the top teams and have a historic run,"" Murray said. ""That might work out or it might not. The thing for us is, what's it look like coming to the rink for the next four years? Brandon is a franchise that I don't think that sits well.

""I know there are fans out there that think we should go all in but the prices for everything are multiple draft picks. I don't think it's a short-term thing that you can have the opportunity to go all the way.

""We still feel really good about our group, but at the same time, you have to be careful. We don't want to be that team that is first in the conference and then the next four years we're battling to keep our heads above water.""

In the age of the super teams assembled through multiple trades, however, Murray acknowledged there is a pressure to keep up.

""It kind of appears to be that way,"" Murray said. ""It's not saying we don't want to win. If there is a time that maybe we can get more aggressive. That's something to look at and might happen down the road. In order to do, a few things have to happen. You have to be healthy, and our biggest prospect and best player has been on the shelf all year and we don't know exactly what is going to happen.""

Brandon has been active participant at the trade deadline in recent years.

A year ago, they sent their captain, Nate Danielson to the Portland Winterhawks for forward Nick Johnson, defenceman Rhett Ravndahl, first-round picks in 2025 and 2027 and a fifth-round pick in 2026.

In 2023, they acquired Nolan Flamand from the Kelowna Rockets and sent Jake Chiasson to the Saskatoon Blades, and back in 2018, they moved Tanner Kaspick to the Victoria Royals and Kale Clague to the Moose Jaw Warriors for picks and players.

Prior to deadline day, Brandon made six trades since the end of last season.

* Jan. 7 -- Defenceman Charlie Elick of Calgary, 18, and a third-round pick in 2026 were sent to the Tri-City Americans for forward Jordan Gavin of Surrey B.C., 18, and defenceman Merrek Arpin of Calgary, 18.

* Jan. 7 -- Defenceman Rhett Ravndahl, 19 of Birch Hills, Sask., was sent to the Kamloops Blazers for a fifth-round pick in 2026.

* Dec. 27 -- A fifth-round pick in 2026 was sent to the Everett Silvertips for goaltender Alex Garrett, 19, of Saskatoon.

* Sept. 24 -- Overage forward Rylan Roersma of Raymond, Alta., was sent to the Edmonton Oil Kings for a second-round pick in 2026 and a fifth-round pick in 2027.

* Sept. 16 -- Defenceman Seth Tansem of Kelowna, 18, was sent to the Wenatchee Wild for a sixth-round pick in 2027.

* June 5 -- Forward Reed Brown of Tempe, Ariz., 16, was sent to the Portland Winterhawks for overage forward Marcus Nguyen of Calgary.

All in all, especially with the return of Bjarnason and forward Dominik Petr from the world juniors, Murray thinks his team is better than it was a week ago.

""I think Jordan Gavin has the ability to do really good things,"" Murray said. ""He's a second overall pick and ranked to go in the second, third, fourth round of the (National Hockey League) draft. I think he can push to be a 100-point pace guy in the second half of the season.

""With Merrek, he's a stay-at-home, knows-what-he-is defenceman and that's what we're hoping to get out of him. When you combine that with getting Petr back, getting Bjarnason back and then the big thing is that we're hopeful Roger will come back at some point. That would be huge for us. We feel really good about our four lines we can put out night in and night out, and if Roger comes back, we're a real deep team up front.""",2025-01-10,the brandon wheat kings traded a goalie and acquired another one on thursday at the western hockey league trade deadline the wheat kings sent 19yearold goalie alex garrett of saskatoon to the wenatchee wild for a fifthround pick in 2028 and then made a deal for the future acquiring 17yearold goalie hudson perry from the edmonton oil kings for a conditional sixthround pick in 2027 the deadline which was moved up a day from its traditional spot on jan 10 by whl general managers passed at 7 pm brandon head coach and general manager marty murray said its been a hectic week it was really busy murray said you talk to everybody its crazy how expensive everything is its tempting but at the same time we engaged in conversations about some of those bigger fish on the market and for us losing a really good young prospect or multiple draft picks is tempting but not a path we really want to explore and do detriment to this window we have as well as the future of our club garrett was acquired from the everett silvertips on dec 27 for a fifthround pick in 2026 he was needed with starter carson bjarnason away with team canada at the world juniors and backup ethan eskit nursing an upperbody injury he aggravated during the christmas break he came in and did an outstanding job for us in an emergency situation murray said of garrett he gave us a chance to win five games and we won four those are big points and he created a conversation for sure about what we were going to do with our goaltending garrett appeared in five games with brandon posting a 4100 record a 240 goalsagainst average and a 917 save percentage unfortunately for him the number that mattered most was 2005 thats his birth year which means he would be an overager next season trying to earn one of the three spots in a deep group that includes defenceman quinn mantei and forwards nick johnson matteo michels and dominik petr eskit has had a real good first half of the season as well and hes a year younger murray said when you throw garrett into the equation agewise him being a 20 next year complicates things if we have a 20yearold goalie then that removes another really good 20yearold we can have who is in our room right now garrett will also get a chance to contend for the starting job in wenatchee while he would have been behind bjarnason if he had stayed perry meanwhile has split this season between the oil kings and the alberta junior hockey leagues drayton valley thunder in four appearances in edmonton he posted a 620 goalsagainst average and 785 save percentage while in the ajhl he has a 326 goalsagainst average and a 913 save percentage in three appearances a product of sexsmith alta he went undrafted in 2022 but was listed out of edmontons training camp and signed with the club on sept 15 2023 in 21 career appearances over two seasons the sixfoottwo 161pound goaltender has a 41130 record a 483 goalsagainst average and a 852 save percentage he is expected to stay in the ajhl unless one of brandons goalies is injured thats a roster management thing a little bit murray said we dont have an 07 2007born goalie in our group were only going to have eskit as it stands right now back for next year so its an opportunity for him to come in and earn an opportunity we did it to protect ourselves and thinking about a worstcase scenario whether its injuries or what have you it makes sense to have another juniorcapable player in case we need to dylan mcfadyen 16 is the only other signed goalie in the organization in total there were 11 deals made across the league on thursday after many of the most highly sought after players were dealt earlier on wednesday the spokane chiefs emerged as a surprise buyer of 19yearold forward andrew cristall from the kelowna rockets the chiefs who havent been aggressive on the trade front this season sent 17yearold forward hayden paupanekis of winnipeg a firstround pick in 2025 a thirdround pick in 2025 a firstround pick in 2027 a secondround pick in 2026 and a sixthround pick to the rockets kelowna is divesting top players as it builds up to host the 2026 memorial cup cristall a prospect of the washington capitals is second in the league in scoring

rocak to the swift current broncos on wednesday the other major shoe to drop came when the saskatoon blades sent 19yearold forward ben riche of bethune sask to the prince george cougars for 18yearold forward hunter laing of kelowna the rights to 15yearold defenceman luke dumas of beaverlodge alta a firstround pick in 2026 and a fifthround pick in 2028 riche is having a career season with 23 goals and 31 assists in 37 games he will be joining his fourth whl team while it would be nice as the head coach to go out and acquire a bunch of talent murray noted the general manager has to be a little more cautious after all its a team thats internally considered to be good enough to contend for the next few years we could have traded away all of our draft picks and built a heckuva team for three months and hope we get past the top teams and have a historic run murray said that might work out or it might not the thing for us is whats it look like coming to the rink for the next four years brandon is a franchise that i dont think that sits well i know there are fans out there that think we should go all in but the prices for everything are multiple draft picks i dont think its a shortterm thing that you can have the opportunity to go all the way we still feel really good about our group but at the same time you have to be careful we dont want to be that team that is first in the conference and then the next four years were battling to keep our heads above water in the age of the super teams assembled through multiple trades however murray acknowledged there is a pressure to keep up it kind of appears to be that way murray said its not saying we dont want to win if there is a time that maybe we can get more aggressive thats something to look at and might happen down the road in order to do a few things have to happen you have to be healthy and our biggest prospect and best player has been on the shelf all year and we dont know exactly what is going to happen brandon has been active participant at the trade deadline in recent years a year ago they sent their captain nate danielson to the portland winterhawks for forward nick johnson defenceman rhett ravndahl firstround picks in 2025 and 2027 and a fifthround pick in 2026 in 2023 they acquired nolan flamand from the kelowna rockets and sent jake chiasson to the saskatoon blades and back in 2018

calgary all in all especially with the return of bjarnason and forward dominik petr from the world juniors murray thinks his team is better than it was a week ago i think jordan gavin has the ability to do really good things murray said hes a second overall pick and ranked to go in the second third fourth round of the national hockey league draft i think he can push to be a 100point pace guy in the second half of the season with merrek hes a stayathome knowswhatheis defenceman and thats what were hoping to get out of him when you combine that with getting petr back getting bjarnason back and then the big thing is that were hopeful roger will come back at some point that would be huge for us we feel really good about our four lines we can put out night in and night out and if roger comes back were a real deep team up front,climate,0
Nguyen eager to tangle with old buddies,"I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies, and CASL agreement.

Marcus Nguyen has been excited about tonight's game for about seven months.

The overage Brandon Wheat Kings forward came to Manitoba in a deal on June 5, 2024 that saw 16-year-old prospect Reed Brown of Tempe, Ariz., head to the Portland Winterhawks.

The teams tangle for the first time since in Western Hockey League action tonight at Westoba Place. The puck drops at 7.

""Ever since I got traded in the summer, it's been a game that's been circled on the calendar,"" the Calgary product Nguyen said. ""Whenever you play your old team, it's always fun and always exciting. I've been looking forward to it ever since the schedule got announced. I think it should be a good one. I'll see some familiar faces.""

Brandon (19-11-3-2) has certainly liked its side of the deal, with Nguyen leading the Wheat Kings in goals with 20, points with 38 and shots on goal with 116. Portland (21-14-2-1), meanwhile, has a fine young player in Brown, who has four goals and five assists in 38 games as a rookie.

Barring an unlikely matchup in the league final, it will be the final WHL game back in Manitoba for overage defenceman Ryder Thompson of Russell, and the first trip home for 18-year-old rookie defenceman Cole Slobodian of Brandon.

Needless to say, Nguyen would be happy to steal two points from them.

""I think that's the goal,"" Nguyen said. ""It's a game against Portland but one of just two home games this month so it's starting off on the right track and getting this road trip going. Obviously it's at home, but you want to leave a good taste in your mouth when you finish at home in front of your fans.""

Neither team has played since last Saturday, with Brandon beating the Prince Albert Raiders 5-3 and Portland falling 6-3 to the Wenatchee Wild.

While Nguyen hasn't seen the Winterhawks in person this season, he has a pretty good idea of what to expect.

""Everyone knows Portland hockey when they see it,"" Nguyen said. ""It's in the transition. All the players like to play the game fast, they think the game fast, they have a lot of skill.

""They have a lot of D-men who can jump up the ice and turn a three-on-two into a four-on-two and open up an option. Our back check is going to be key, managing pucks in their zone and not turning them over is going to be key because that's what good teams feed off of. It's a good team on the other side.""

Brandon head coach and general manager Marty Murray agreed.

""They're a really highly skilled team,"" Murray said. ""Their transition game is one of the best if not the best in the league and they can score. We have to pay attention, especially to their top six guys and they have a couple of D who can really get involved in the play as well. They will be a handful. They really play with pace, and we'll have to be ready to skate.""

One difference from Nguyen's time in Oregon is that former Brandon University Bobcats player Mike Johnston is no longer the head coach after 13 seasons behind the bench. Johnston remains as president and general manager, but his veteran assistant and associate coach Kyle Gustafson slid into the top job.

In Portland's last game in Brandon, Quinn Mantei scored the winner in a 3-2 Wheat Kings victory on Jan. 6, 2023.

Last season, however, Portland pounded Brandon 11-1 at home on Oct. 18, 2023, with Nguyen earning a pair of assists against his future club.

Murray chuckled when asked if that might be mentioned to his team.

""It will be,"" Murray said. ""Last year in Portland it was 11-1. I think my last two trips into Portland as a player were 10-1 and 11-1 so it's maybe it's nice we have a break and don't go there this year. I think we played them here two years and came out in a tight one.

""In general, the focus is getting back to playing well on home ice. I think we've lost three in a row, one of them in s shootout, but we want to be a good team at home and hopefully have a good effort before we head out on the B.C. trip.""

Overall, the Wheat Kings are 10-5-3-2 at home and 9-6-0-0 on the road.

The Wheat Kings visit the Calgary Hitmen on Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. (CT) as they head west to embark on their annual trip through the Western Conference, which this year focuses on the B.C. Division but includes a bonus U.S. Division game.

They visit the Victoria Royals on Wednesday at 9:05 p.m. (all times CST), the Everett Silvertips on Friday at 9:05 p.m., the Vancouver Giants on Sunday at 4 p.m., the Kelowna Rockets on Tuesday, Jan. 21 at 9:05 p.m., the Kamloops Blazers on Wednesday, Jan. 22 at 9 p.m., and finish up 1,902 kilometres from Brandon against the Prince George Cougars on Friday, Jan. 24.

Their next home game is on Jan. 29 when the Red Deer Rebels visit.

The Wheat Kings are getting close to healthy, with goalie Ethan Eskit and rookie forward Ben Binder Nord full participants in practice. Joby Baumuller was also on the ice but wearing a red non-contact jersey.

The other injured forwards, Roger McQueen and Easton Odut, both remain out indefinitely.

The Wheat Kings also had their two new faces at practice, with forward Jordan Gavin and defenceman Merrek Arpin arriving in Manitoba on Wednesday evening after catching flights. The two were acquired from the Tri-City Americans on Wednesday for defenceman Charlie Elick and a third-round pick in 2026.

* Portland scorers: Michal Kvasnica, Seth Jarvis, Jaydon Dureau, Joachim Blichfeld.

GRAINS-Chicago soyoil hits seven-week high on clean fuel tax credit...,"BEIJING, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Chicago soyoil futures jumped to a seven-week peak on Friday, following expectations for President Joe Biden's administration to release short-term guidance on clean fuel tax credits, setting it on course for a 10% weekly jump.

Soybean and corn edged higher, also headed for weekly gains as traders adjusted their positions ahead of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's key supply-and-demand report.

Wheat prices slipped, as traders struggled to find bullish drivers, with a stronger dollar adding pressure.

FUNDAMENTALS

* The most-active soybean oil contract for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) rose 3% to $44 a bushel, up for a fifth session to its highest since Nov. 21.

* Chicago soybean rose 0.3% at $10.02 a bushel by 0121 GMT. For the week, the contract has risen 1%, up for a third week.

* Chicago corn inched up 0.11% to $4.56-6/8, on course for a 1.3% weekly rise. That would be its sixth weekly gain in seven weeks. Wheat fell 0.23% to $5.33 a bushel but is set for a 0.9% weekly gain.

* President Joe Biden's administration expects to release short-term guidance on clean fuel tax credits on Friday and leave final decisions to President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, according to two sources familiar with the plan.

* Rains are needed to refresh Argentina's parched soy and corn crops, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange said on Thursday, which is expected to come within the next week after weeks of hot and dry weather.

* Ahead of Friday's USDA export sales report, analysts expect U.S. wheat sales for the week ending Jan. 2 to range from 150,000-500,000 metric tons, corn from 700,000-1,400,000 tons, and soybeans from 400,000-1,300,000 tons.

* Analysts, on average, expect the USDA to raise its crop estimate for the world's top supplier to a record 170.28 million tons.

* Ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies continues to inject volatility into the markets.

* The dollar looked set to extend its longest weekly winning streak in over a year on Friday, underpinned by rising bond yields and expectations of another strong set of U.S. jobs numbers.

* The Taiwan Flour Millers' Association purchased an estimated 114,650 tons of milling wheat sourced from the United States in a tender, European traders said.

* Commodity funds were net buyers of Chicago Board of Trade corn, soyoil, soybean and wheat futures contracts on Thursday and net sellers of soymeal, traders said.

MARKET NEWS

* U.S. Treasury yields retreated from an eight-month high, while the dollar strengthened against major currencies, as investors re-evaluated the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy for 2025 as the U.S. economy shows signs of resilience.

Crop switching boosts climate resilience in Chinese agriculture,"China's food production has nearly doubled since the 1980s, primarily driven by intensified nutrient application and expanded irrigation. With food demand projected to grow further, researchers Qi Guan and colleagues utilized a dynamic global vegetation model to analyze the nation's agricultural system under different 21st-century climate scenarios.

The team developed models aimed at maximizing crop yields while curbing nitrogen leaching and water consumption. These scenarios were designed to minimize supply chain disruptions and ensure long-term food security, even under varying climatic conditions.

Under optimal crop distribution scenarios, productivity could increase by 14.1%, nitrogen leaching decrease by 8.2%, and water use drop by 24.0%. Northern China's warming climate and increasing summer rainfall make it a promising area for rice cultivation. Shifting maize away from arid regions could significantly reduce water usage.

The study suggests that drought-resistant wheat could flourish in the Northeast China Plain, while soybeans may thrive in northern and northwestern regions as well as the Yangtze Plain. Water-intensive crops like potatoes could be better suited to eastern and southern China. According to the researchers, coordinated national efforts in crop switching could deliver substantial environmental and productivity gains.

Daily Report,"We got a decent freeze here in North Florida early this morning. That's what the garden fence looked like when I took the compost out. We turned on the sprinklers last night so that the pipes wouldn't freeze up.

And they didn't.

Some of you must find it so funny that we Floridians get excited whenever ice forms outside naturally. ""Ooooh!"" we say. ""It's so cold!"" And we shiver dramatically in our warmest sweaters and coats. We are just not experienced with freezing temperatures. They come, sure, but in a day or two, or maybe three, they're gone. And yes, occasionally it snows. Not very often but enough to know it can. The last time it snowed here, I think, was in 2018. I wrote a post about it with pictures. You can find that HERE.

No snow in the forecast now, although there is a 75% chance of rain tomorrow. It's going to warm up a tiny bit, enough to push us up over that freezing temperature.

Today was a big ol' waste of time. I had a follow-up appointment for my colonoscopy and I have no idea why. I suspect so that they could charge our insurance company for it PLUS I had to make a $40 co-pay. WTF? I should have just canceled the damn thing but no, I had to be a good little patient and show up on time and meet with the gastroenterologist's NP.

I refused to be weighed or have my BP taken. ""Nope,"" I said. ""Not doing that.""

The poor nurse. She said, ""Do you know what you weigh?""

""Just check my chart for the last time I was here,"" I said.

And I suppose she did.

The NP is a very sweet young woman. She appears to be approximately Owen's age. Maybe I could introduce them. She asked me if I had any questions. I said, ""Yes. Why am I even having this appointment?""

""I don't know. I didn't schedule it!"" she said. ""Your colonoscopy was perfectly clean and clear so I was a bit shocked to see it had been scheduled.""

""Harumph,"" I said.

Well, not out loud.

I suppose to make sure she was giving it her all, she did check my heart and lungs and said, ""Perfect,"" which is what she said at my pre-procedure appointment. I like that word, perfect. She also advised me to get plenty of fiber. I assured her I did and I would.

The situation at Moon Plaza is still an ongoing story. It's so complicated. Glen's been working with the Tallahassee Police Department's homeless outreach officer. According to the woman who is running the hospice thrift store, this morning there were four people back down in the area that burned yesterday with a fire going. And by the way- some propane canisters exploded in the fire. Also, one woman was slightly injured and was treated at the local emergency room. Officers responded today but supposedly found no one. The entire camp and all of the detritus is going to be cleared by the city and the area will be posted for no trespassing. But once again- now where do the people who have made that camp their home go?

The traditional media here is being very closed-mouthed about this whole situation. I would not hazard a guess as to why. So, so many questions. So very few answers.

Meanwhile, here at home, I can't believe that tomorrow is Friday. For a week in which I accomplished almost nothing, it has flown by. I've picked greens for a shrimp salad in the garden which seems to have survived the freezing temperatures very well. I have bread rising that has oat bran and whole wheat in it. Lots of fiber! And it will be lovely.

I am sure that all of us are aghast at what is happening in California right now. I can only think of what is happening as a fire hurricane and I have to say, I never in my life want to experience that and cannot even begin to imagine what it must be like. I had never even heard of such a thing.

But oh yes- wind turbines cause cancer and Canada is just refusing to turn on that big giant faucet that will allow water to run downhill to Los Angeles where it is so desperately needed.

We are so fucked.

But hey! Just like covid, it's all just going to magically disappear.

Irritable bowel syndrome affects 20% of North Americans - The Okanagan Naturopath,"Photo: Pixabay

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of chronic diarrhea and lower abdominal discomfort in North America.

It is a benign disorder of the colon, or large intestine, and is typically characterized by periods of diarrhea often alternating with bouts of constipation.

This syndrome is estimated to affect up to 20% of the North American population. It accounts for 50% to 75% of all people with digestive complaints and represents 30% to 50% of referrals to gastroenterologists or specialists in treating digestive disorders.

It commonly begins in individuals between the age of 20 and 40 years but can also occur in young children and the elderly. It is one of the most frequent causes of diarrhea in young children. Although IBS occurs in the elderly, it is an uncommon cause of diarrhea in that age group.

Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome include alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation, abdominal pain, bloating, cramping, flatulence, belching, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, variable appetite, poor digestion and difficulty swallowing. Fever, gastro-intestinal bleeding and weight loss are not part of the syndrome and may suggest a more serious underlying disorder.

The exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome is not fully known. It is generally agreed IBS is a disorder of movement of digestive material or muscle contraction of the colon and intestines. Factors that affect large and small intestine motility include psychological and emotional stressors, diet, especially lack of fibre and increased consumption of refined carbohydrates.

Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome is usually made after other more serious gastro-intestinal disorders have been ruled out. It is based on history, presenting symptoms and lab tests to rule out other disorders. Other conditions may mimic IBS and include excessive consumption of coffee, tea, cola and refined sugars, intestinal infection, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, lactose intolerance, laxative abuse, drug induced intestinal inflammation, diverticulitis, liver and gall bladder disease pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption symptoms, diabetes, hypothyroidism, scar tissue and cancer.

Conventional medical treatment of irritable bowel syndrome focuses on drug therapy to provide relief of the symptoms associated with this disorder. Anti-cholinergic, anti-diarrheal, anti-ulcer and psychotropic drugs may be prescribed for symptom relief. Prescribed medication includes the anti-cholinergic drugs Imodium (loperamide), Lomotil (diphenoxylate) or other narcotic medicines, beta-blockers, prostaglandin inhibitors and a variety of psychotropic drugs and muscle relaxants.

Stress is strongly associated with the development of irritable bowel syndrome. Stressors should be identified and reduced when possible. Meditation, yoga and biofeedback are effective techniques that can help the digestive system relax and prevent spasms. Exercise is also a great way to reduce stress and should be a part of daily routine. The combination of behavioural modification and medical treatment is a very effective combination in altering the course of IBS.

Diet and food choices can play an important role in the development and progression of IBS. Refined and ultra-processed carbohydrates can aggravate intestinal muscle spasms. Added white sugar and other refined sweeteners should be minimized. Coffee, tea, colas and other caffeine laden beverages and drinks should be reduced or eliminated. Caffeine and other stimulants induce intestinal muscle contractions and can make diarrhea worse.

A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) can help dramatically reduce symptoms of IBS in some individuals. Saccharides are basically simple sugars found in different foods. Bacteria in the large and small intestine can break down and ferment these simple sugars thereby creating gas, bloating, diarrhea and other symptoms of intestinal discomfort.

Food sensitivities and allergies are often implicated as triggering agents for IBS. An elimination challenge protocol, allergy or sensitivity test can help to identify possibly offending foods. Commonly identified offending foods include wheat, milk and other dairy products, beef, pork, soy, corn, coffee, citrus fruits, nightshade vegetables including tomatoes and an array of different fruits. Increase consumption of naturally occurring high fibre foods from whole grains and cereals, vegetables and high-quality protein foods.

The standard North American diet lacks adequate amounts of dietary fibre. Indigestible fibre can help increase stool bulk, both increase and decrease stool transit time and help both constipation and diarrhea. Whole grain and cereals sources like wheat bran, oat bran, psyllium and flaxseed can be good sources of fibre.

Digestive enzymes can help improve digestion of foods and improve symptoms associated with IBS. Hydrochloric acid supplementation is warranted when low levels occur in the stomach.

Probiotics or good bacteria found in fermented foods can help some individuals with IBS. These bacteria and yeast include species Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces.

Carminative herbs contain low doses of oils that help to relieve symptoms of gas and bloating associated with IBS. They include caraway, chamomile, fennel, ginger, lemon balm, peppermint and rosemary. Special enteric-coated peppermint capsules relax large and small intestines cramps and gas pains.

Worker Rights Bill Introduced in Colorado Senate - Yellow Scene Magazine,"Press releases are provided to Yellow Scene Magazine. In an effort to keep our community informed, we publish some press releases in whole.

DENVER - Today Sens. Robert Rodriguez (D-Denver, Majority Leader) and Jessie Danielson (D-Wheat Ridge) introduced the Worker Protection Act (SB25-005) to update Colorado's labor law so workers have more freedom to negotiate for better pay and workplace safety. Currently, Colorado law interferes with employer-employee relations by limiting what they can discuss until workers win two separate elections. So far, more than 50 Colorado organizations are in support of the bill, which has 16 Senate co-sponsors and 33 House co-sponsors.

""It's time to stand up for workers who want the freedom to negotiate so they can put more money in their families' pockets, decrease the wealth gap and increase worker safety,"" said sponsor Sen. Robert Rodriguez. ""Working families shouldn't have to struggle to get by while corporations and investors just get richer. I'm proud to introduce legislation that will eliminate unnecessary barriers Colorado workers face when they want to level the playing field with their employer.""

Workers in Colorado must win two elections to form a strong union, a barrier not faced in any other state. The first is a simple majority for union recognition, in alignment with federal law. Colorado is the only state that requires a second supermajority vote for workers who want to negotiate ""union security,"" which means all workers benefiting from contract bargaining and ongoing representation pay their share of representation fees - but does not require union membership.

Even if Colorado workers win the second election, there is no guarantee they'll win union security, only that it can be on the agenda for negotiation talks. Holding a second election subjects workers to a second round of bullying and intimidation, making it even more difficult to negotiate for better pay and safer worksites.

""Our union organizing for a safer workplace accelerated after a pallet weighing hundreds of pounds fell and broke my co-worker's back, something I saw with my own eyes,"" said Larson Ross, a former Hello Fresh warehouse worker. ""Once 70 percent of workers signed union support cards, management retaliated by interrogating, intimidating and cutting our schedules and pay. Workers were bullied into dropping their support during the first election and we lost our vote. Why should workers seeking safety and better pay be forced to go through this at all, let alone twice?""

A recent Colorado Fiscal Institute study showed the Worker Protection Act will improve the economic standing of working families, boosting the economy as a whole. Unions help companies retain more tenured, productive workers, reducing turnover costs by increasing job satisfaction and giving employees a voice in their working conditions. Despite corporate lobbyists' warnings, evidence suggests unions don't cause business failures or businesses to leave the state. In fact, the decline of unions may slow economic growth by increasing inequality and shifting more profits to the pockets of corporations and the wealthy.

""The union was my ticket into the middle class,"" said Ronnie Houston, a Yellow Freight truck driver for 50 years in Colorado Springs. ""Not only did a strong union mean we could negotiate critical safety protections in a dangerous industry, but it also gave my family the financial stability that allowed us to buy a home, cover our health care costs, send our kids to college and trade school and retire without worry.""

Climate Change Threatens Agriculture,"India's rice and wheat yields are projected to decline by 6-10% due to climate change, threatening food security for millions, senior government officials have warned. One major reason for this is that the changes in climate are reducing the frequency and intensity of Western Disturbances, which bring winter rain and snow to northwest India, leading to water shortages for over two billion people dependent on Himalayan rivers. Experts from the India Meteorological Department and Ministry of Earth Sciences have pointed out the growing erratic nature of weather patterns, with extreme events becoming more frequent and harder to predict. Staples for India's 1.4 billion population like wheat and

rice make up 14 percent of global food supplies. Climate change could reduce wheat and rice yields by 6-10 percent, posing serious challenges to the nation's food security.

Rice is also a staple in Kashmir, and we import it in large quantities to compensate for the low paddy output in the region. Now climate change is threatening to further reduce the local rice production by depleting the water resources. Jammu and Kashmir boasts approximately 18,000 glaciers, including large ones like Siachen glacier. These glaciers are an invaluable resource, serving as a lifeline for the region, providing water for agriculture. However, with temperatures on the rise due to climate change, these glaciers are melting at an accelerated pace.

ADVERTISEMENT

One of the most pressing concerns is the shift in the timing of water availability. Historically, the Valley has relied on the gradual release of water from melting glaciers during the crucial months of June and July, coinciding with the agricultural season when water demand is at its peak. However, changing climate patterns have disrupted this cycle, leading to a surplus of water in March, April, and May when it is not required. It has dire implications for the ecosystem and the people who depend on it. The melting glaciers disrupt the traditional water supply cycle, severely affecting agriculture.

In Kashmir, the impact of climate change on agriculture is further exacerbated by the shrinking paddy lands. According to official figures, over the past seven years, Kashmir has lost a staggering 6,000 hectares of paddy land, reducing the total land under paddy cultivation from 1,35,000 hectares to 1,29,000 hectares. Although there has been a significant increase in rice yield.

This threatens both food security and the livelihoods of the people. Although the magnitude of this problem is so huge that mere government policies and interventions can't alter the factors that are global in scale. But yes, government interventions can certainly make a redeeming difference and is the need of the hour.",2025-01-10,indias rice and wheat yields are projected to decline by 610 due to climate change threatening food security for millions senior government officials have warned one major reason for this is that the changes in climate are reducing the frequency and intensity of western disturbances which bring winter rain and snow to northwest india leading to water shortages for over two billion people dependent on himalayan rivers experts from the india meteorological department and ministry of earth sciences have pointed out the growing erratic nature of weather patterns with extreme events becoming more frequent and harder to predict staples for indias 14 billion population like wheat and rice make up 14 percent of global food supplies climate change could reduce wheat and rice yields by 610 percent posing serious challenges to the nations food security rice is also a staple in kashmir and we import it in large quantities to compensate for the low paddy output in the region now climate change is threatening to further reduce the local rice production by depleting the water resources jammu and kashmir boasts approximately 18000 glaciers including large ones like siachen glacier these glaciers are an invaluable resource serving as a lifeline for the region providing water for agriculture however with temperatures on the rise due to climate change these glaciers are melting at an accelerated pace advertisement one of the most pressing concerns is the shift in the timing of water availability historically the valley has relied on the gradual release of water from melting glaciers during the crucial months of june and july coinciding with the agricultural season when water demand is at its peak however changing climate patterns have disrupted this cycle leading to a surplus of water in march april and may when it is not required it has dire implications for the ecosystem and the people who depend on it the melting glaciers disrupt the traditional water supply cycle severely affecting agriculture advertisement in kashmir the impact of climate change on agriculture is further exacerbated by the shrinking paddy lands according to official figures over the past seven years kashmir has lost a staggering 6000 hectares of paddy land reducing the total land under paddy cultivation from 135000 hectares to 129000 hectares although there has been a significant increase in rice yield this threatens both food security and the livelihoods of the people although the magnitude of this problem is so huge that mere government policies and interventions cant alter the factors that are global in scale but yes government interventions can certainly make a redeeming difference and is the need of the hour,climate,0
India-Taliban talks  --  realism in Acting West,"The Taliban is here to stay and with India capitalising on traditional friendship, there is scope for Afghanistan to figure even more prominently in Delhi's ""Act West"" policy

Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri's meeting with the Taliban's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai on January 8 is not just part of the engagement of the regime in Kabul but a significant elevation in the level of dialogue. India, like the rest of the international community, has yet to accord formal recognition to the Taliban regime which saw off US forces from Kabul in August 2021 amidst chaotic scenes reminiscent of the helicopter evacuation of thousands from Saigon in 1975, only much worse.

Since the transition in Kabul, India has kept alive channels of communication with the Taliban at the functional level. Misri's meeting took place against the backdrop of considerable geopolitical ferment. Two days earlier, the Indian foreign ministry spokesman had roundly condemned the Pakistani airstrikes against Afghanistan that resulted in the loss of ""several precious lives"", including women and children.

Pakistan's claim that the target was the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) camps has not cut ice with Kabul, which has labelled these brazen acts as ""aggression against Afghanistan"". The TTP is fighting to evict all Pakistani forces from Pashtun tribal lands across the so-called Durand Line. Mortimer Durand's eponymous line of 1893, a colonial cartographic caper, is regarded as an ""imaginary line"" by the Taliban, whose sympathy for the TTP's pan-Pashtun ambitions has set Pakistan's teeth on edge. In February 2024, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, Taliban's acting deputy minister of foreign affairs, categorically stated that Afghanistan will never recognise the Durand Line. Pakistani demands for ""border"" crossings using consular documents have also been dismissed.

In Pakistan's case, there are some ironies. First, Pakistan has always considered Afghanistan to be a weak and vulnerable hinterland to be exploited and dominated in order to achieve ""strategic depth"" against India. Now, an emboldened Taliban is threatening Pakistan's western flank, which it has always taken for granted. According to a UN Security Council report, there are an estimated 6,000-6,500 TTP fighters waging war against Pakistan, operating from Afghanistan. The Taliban's support for the TTP remains strong amidst mounting instances of TTP attacks against Pakistan.

Second, as the saying goes ""as you sow, so shall you reap"". Pakistan has harboured many terrorist groups as part of its insidious policy towards India. It was a key progenitor of the Taliban during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Now, the chickens have come home to roost. The TTP's Pashtun nationalism haunts Islamabad.

Links between the Taliban, TTP and al-Qaeda remain resilient. The Taliban and al-Qaeda make common cause in dealing with the virulent Islamic State (Khorasan Province). Just as the Taliban's return had proved a boost for terrorist networks, not far away, Syria has recently been overrun by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), still regarded by the UN and US as a terrorist organisation. The revocation of the $10 million bounty on the head of HTS leader Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa on grounds of expediency gives rise to the question of whether there is scope for similar rehabilitation of the current regime in Afghanistan.

Top UN, US, EU, Turkish and Jordanian diplomats, as well as the foreign ministers of Germany and France, are dealing with the new regime in Damascus but not with the Taliban. This is despite the fact that the Syrian groups that have come together under the HTS umbrella have also been egregious in their violation of human rights and the treatment of minorities.

India has done well to engage the Taliban at a senior level. China and others such as Russia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Pakistan were quick to interact with Taliban 2.0 including through their local diplomatic missions. After the Taliban's takeover, India had recalled all its personnel but later restituted its presence in Kabul by dispatching a ""technical team"" to its embassy in 2022.

The ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"" yearns for recognition. The UN Credentials Committee has turned down its request for the fourth consecutive year. However, the current situation does provide an opportunity for India to deploy a new modus vivendi in its dealings with the Taliban even if international recognition, for now, remains a chimera. The Afghan cricket team's dizzying rise has led to players like Rashid Khan being auctioned for hefty sums in the Indian Premier League (IPL). It augurs well that India has also offered to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the popular game of cricket, which is a way of reaching out to the Afghan youth.

Following the Misri-Muttaqi tête-à-tête, India has committed to ""provide further material support in the first instance to the health sector and for the rehabilitation of refugees"" by way of humanitarian assistance. Pakistan has expelled more than 5,00,000 refugees, creating a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. Given that Iran too has had border skirmishes with Pakistan on account of the latter providing sanctuaries to separatists, this is an opportune moment to work in tandem with Iran, using Chabahar Port to expand trade and send assistance to the refugees. India could benefit by involving Tehran more closely in meeting Afghanistan's humanitarian needs. Iran still has regional sway in some quarters and has recently offered to help mediate with Yemen to secure clemency for Nimisha Priya, an Indian nurse on death row.

India has supplied essential medicines, Covid and polio vaccines, anti-tuberculosis medicines, surgical items, drug de-addiction hygiene kits, blankets, winter clothing, pesticides, stationery for students as well as large consignments of wheat to Afghanistan. In the Union Budget for 2024-25, India allocated assistance for Afghanistan to the tune of Rs 200 crore.

Keeping in mind the complex geopolitical chessboard, India should enhance humanitarian assistance and resume development projects in Afghanistan. Capitalising on traditional friendship, there is scope for Afghanistan to figure even more prominently in India's ""Act West"" policy. The Taliban, after all, is here to stay.

Best of both sides | Ashok Gulati writes: Why MSP should not be legalised,"India is the only country that implicitly taxes its agriculture by suppressing market prices. What Indian farmers need is freer markets

Let me start by saying that my heart bleeds when I see farmers agitating over prices for their produce. I have spent my entire professional life working for the betterment of agriculturists. But rational policymaking requires much more than compassion. It requires a better understanding of how the economy functions, especially the market economy. Having worked on the agriculture of various Asian and African countries, I can confidently say that legalising minimum support prices (MSPs) would be a folly -- it would throw a spanner in the working of the economy. Making MSPs effective is different from making MSPs legal. Let me elaborate.

In a market economy, the price of any product is decided by the forces of demand and supply. Suppose the production of a commodity in any year is 100 units and its demand is 75 units. In such a situation, the price of that commodity would fall. With reduced prices, demand expands, supply shrinks, and finally, the market clears. If MSP is made legal and is high, creating a situation of supply exceeding demand by 25 units (100-75), no private player will come forward to offer a price lower than MSP as it would be illegal to do so. In that case, farmers would be saddled with these extra 25 units that no one is willing to buy at the declared MSP. The entire excess supply will become the responsibility of the government. How much the government can buy, and for how many commodities, and at how many places is an open question that needs serious thinking and analysis.

Some activists suggest price deficiency payments. Several cost estimates of such a scheme are being floated. The problem with such a scheme is that if MSP is declared legal, then there would be no real market price below MSP. Then the government becomes the open-ended buyer of all commodities for which MSPs are declared, which are 23 as on day. If one argues that MSP is not legal, and agri-markets do exist and price discovery is possible, but farmers need to be compensated for the difference between MSP and lower market prices as price deficiency payments to farmers, we are talking about a different policy -- making MSP more of an income instrument. The downside of such a policy is that the moment traders know that the government will compensate the farmers by the difference in MSP and market prices, they are likely to push market prices even lower, and there is a high probability that farmers and traders will collude in showing market prices much lower than the MSP. That would make it very difficult to estimate the hit to the financial exchequer. The price deficiency mechanism was tried earnestly in Madhya Pradesh, and just after one season, the government had to give it up precisely because of this reason. If the government wants to make MSP more effective (not legal), it can create a stabilisation fund of about Rs 25,000 crore, especially focused on pulses and oilseeds of which India is a net importer.

It may be worth noting that the 23 MSP crops constitute roughly 30 per cent of the value of agriculture. Within these 23 crops, MSP is properly implemented in the case of rice and wheat, that too in a few states. The Centre's latest Situation Assessment Survey revealed that not more than 10 per cent of farmers sold their produce at MSP. It may also be noted that this MSP policy is an offshoot of the acute grain deficit in the mid-1960s. It won't be economically prudent if the same policy is applied when India is surplus in basic staples.

Now, let us turn to the non-MSP segment of agriculture which is facing free markets. During 2010-11 to 2022-23, for which we have the latest data, fishery has been growing at 8.2 per cent per annum, meat at 7.3 per cent, eggs at 6 per cent, milk at 5.3 per cent, and horticulture at 4.7 per cent per annum. None of these agri-commodities have MSP, and they are more perishable than wheat and rice. But wheat has grown at 2.5 per cent and paddy at 3.2 per cent over the same period. This clearly shows that market-based systems have performed much better than the government-controlled MSP regime for wheat and rice.

However, this does not mean that markets are perfect. They are often distorted by the government through export bans, stocking limits on private trade, suspension of futures and options at the drop of a hat, and so on. All this is done in the name of keeping agri-inflation low for consumers. So, there is an inherent consumer bias in the agri-price policy, which implicitly becomes anti-farmer. Amongst the G20 countries, as per OECD, India is the only country that has negative Producer Support Estimates (PSEs), meaning that India implicitly taxes its agriculture by suppressing market prices. What Indian farmers need is freer markets, building of agri-value chains -- like the AMUL model in milk -- where farmers can get 75 to 80 per cent of what consumer pays. Making MSP legal will be going backwards, which is not in line with the liberalisation of the economy.

Climate Crisis: Jhelum Water Level At Alarming Low,"According to the details, the Jhelum at Sangam point is currently flowing at a distressing level of -0.75 feet, while at RAM Munshi Bagh, the water level stands at 3.73 feet and at Asham at 1.08 feet. ADVERTISEMENT

These measurements indicate a severe drop in water flow, which is unprecedented for this time of the year. ADVERTISEMENT

Similarly Lidder Nallah and Rambiara Nallah, are also facing critical lows, with the former flowing at -0.38 meters at Batkote and the latter at -0.47 meters at Wachi.

A top official of the Irrigation and Flood Control department while talking to KNO said,""The River Jhelum is witnessing below zero flow. Main source of Jhelum are glaciers but unfortunately these are losing sheen due to Kashmir witnessing prolonged dry spells.""

He said,""The various water supply schemes are being hit across Kashmir due to Jhelum becoming dry. It's a cause of concern.""

Experts have warned that these figures are symptomatic of a larger environmental crisis fuelled by erratic climate patterns and prolonged dry spells.

Independent Weather Forecaster, Faizan Arif Keng said,""The current dry spell, which has persisted since October, has further aggravated the situation. In fact, the Jhelum had already recorded a historic low of -1.0 feet earlier this season.""

""Over the past five years, Jammu and Kashmir has experienced below-normal precipitation during the critical winter months of December to February, which has significantly hampered the replenishment of glaciers that feed the river,"" he added.

""Rising temperatures throughout the year have accelerated the melting of glaciers while reducing their overall size. Summer and winter months have seen below-normal rainfall, exacerbating the problem as water sources continue to dwindle,"" Keng said.

He warned that this trend of higher-than-average temperatures and irregular precipitation patterns is likely to continue, threatening the region's water security.

Another expert said,""Jammu and Kashmir has lost nearly 30 percent of glaciers in the past 60 years and if the same trend continues 70 per cent of them will recede by the end of this century.""

""There are 18000 glaciers in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, but all of them are melting. The glaciers are melting in the entire Himalaya including J&K,"" he added.

Dr Irfan Rashid, Assistant Professor at Department of Earth Sciences University of Kashmir, said

that a research has been done, which states that Kashmir's biggest glacier, Kolahoi glacier has melted around 25 per cent since 1960's.""From 1962-2022, it has melted around 25 per cent. It has been receding 35 meters every year,"" he had said, adding that Kolahoi glacier is the biggest glacier of Kashmir, and at the same time, is the fastest melting glacier as well.""

What are the ingredients in Sun Coast Sciences ReActivate?

Vitamin C is renowned for its powerful antioxidant properties, which help combat free radicals that contribute to skin aging. This essential vitamin is crucial in collagen synthesis, promoting skin firmness and elasticity. By neutralizing harmful oxidative stress and reducing inflammation, Vitamin C can brighten the complexion and diminish the appearance of dark spots, leading to a more youthful and radiant skin tone.

Vitamin D is vital for bone health and plays a significant role in skin health. It helps regulate skin cell production and can aid in the repair of damaged skin. Moreover, Vitamin D has been linked to improved skin barrier function, which helps retain moisture and protect against environmental aggressors. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also assist in managing certain skin conditions, making it an essential ingredient for overall skin vitality.

Copper is a trace mineral that supports various enzymatic processes essential for skin health. It helps form collagen and elastin, two proteins critical for maintaining skin structure. Copper also possesses antioxidant properties, which help protect the skin from free radical damage. Additionally, it aids in wound healing and skin regeneration, making it a vital component in any anti-aging formulation.

Manganese is another trace mineral that contributes to skin health by acting as a cofactor for antioxidant enzymes. It is essential for the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans, which are vital for maintaining skin hydration and elasticity. Manganese also plays a role in collagen production, thereby supporting skin structure and resilience against aging. By reducing oxidative stress, it helps promote a more youthful appearance.

Boost collagen naturally -- try ReActivate for firmer, radiant skin.

MSM is a naturally occurring compound known for its anti-inflammatory properties. It aids in producing keratin, a protein that helps maintain skin structure and integrity. MSM has been shown to enhance skin hydration and elasticity, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Its ability to promote collagen production further supports skin rejuvenation, making it a valuable ingredient in anti-aging products.

Grape Seed Extract is rich in proanthocyanidins, powerful antioxidants that help protect the skin from oxidative stress. These compounds promote healthy circulation and support collagen production, enhancing skin elasticity and firmness. With its anti-inflammatory properties, Grape Seed Extract can also reduce skin irritation and redness, leading to a more even and radiant complexion.

Turmeric is celebrated for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The active compounds, known as curcuminoids, help reduce inflammation and protect the skin from environmental damage. Turmeric can brighten the skin, improve complexion, and promote a youthful glow. Its ability to combat free radicals can help mitigate signs of aging, making it an essential addition to any skincare regimen.

Ceramosides are plant-derived compounds that help restore skin barrier function. They enhance skin hydration and elasticity, creating a plumper and youthful appearance. By reinforcing the skin's natural protective barrier, Ceramosides help prevent moisture loss and protect against environmental stressors, making them a powerful ally in the fight against aging.

Trans-Pterostilbene is a potent antioxidant known for its anti-aging properties. It helps reduce oxidative stress, promotes cellular health, and enhances skin rejuvenation. By targeting senescent cells, it can help improve skin clarity and brightness. Its ability to support collagen production further reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, making it a cornerstone of any effective anti-aging formula.

One of the standout benefits of Sun Coast Sciences ReActivate is its ability to rejuvenate tired, aging skin.

Wrinkles are one of the most visible signs of aging, and ReActivate addresses this concern head-on. The product's formulation is designed to rebuild lost collagen and elastin, essential components that help keep the skin firm and youthful. As users incorporate ReActivate into their daily routine, they often notice a gradual reduction in the appearance of fine lines and deep wrinkles. The combination of MSM, Grape Seed Extract, and Ceramosides is crucial in promoting skin elasticity and firmness, effectively erasing the signs of aging.

The ingredients' anti-inflammatory properties also contribute to smoother skin texture, further diminishing the appearance of wrinkles. With consistent use, many individuals report a visible improvement in their skin's overall appearance, leading to a more youthful and refreshed look. This benefit particularly appeals to those who have tried various topical treatments without significant results.

Our skin loses its firmness and elasticity as we age, leading to sagging and loose skin. Sun Coast Sciences ReActivate is formulated to combat this issue effectively. The powerful ceramides in the blend work to rebuild and tighten the skin's structure, promoting a smoother and more lifted appearance. Users have reported noticeable tightening effects, especially in areas prone to sagging, such as the jawline and neck.

By addressing the underlying causes of sagging skin, this supplement provides a comprehensive solution for those seeking to regain their youthful contours.

"After Pathankot weaves a success story, Doaba belt set to take the silk route","Buoyed by the success of the sericulture pilot project in Pathankot, Punjab is all set to expand silk production to the Doaba belt within a year.

The state forest department has roped in 46 economically marginalised villagers from Hoshiarpur to produce silk cocoons.

In 2022, as part of a pilot project to check viability of sericulture, the state forest department had provided training and infrastructure to 116 villagers, most of them belonging to the Scheduled Caste community, having no or small landholdings, in the underdeveloped Dhar revenue block of Pathankot.

As part of the project, nearly 40,000 mulberry trees were planted in Pathankot, with its leaves - which are the only source of food for silkworms -- being provided to the sericulturists for free.

""In the last two years, about 6 tonnes of silk cocoon was produced in Pathankot. All support - sheds for silkworm cultivation, mulberry leaves, mandi to sell reared cocoons -- was provided to farmers under a Centre-funded project, supported by Bengaluru-based Central Silk Board,"" said Sanjeev Tiwari, conservator of forests (north circle). He said the silkworms for the project were purchased from West Bengal, Karnataka and other places.

""At least, 12,000 saplings have already been planted in Hoshiarpur and another 10,000 will be sown in the next phase,"" said Tiwari.

He added that in Pathankot, a factory to produce silk thread would also be set up in the next four to five months and it will become operational within a year.

Villagers in the sub-mountainous areas near the Shivalik foothills, known as kandi areas, where conventional farming is a challenge due to constrained natural resources, said that sericulture has the potential to improve their economic condition.

Manohar Lal, 60, of Pathankot's Durang Khad village, who owns seven kanals of land, said, ""We have small landholdings, and that too in the semi-hilly regions, which are not viable for wheat and maize cultivation. I have been in sericulture for almost a decade, but things improved since I got associated with the forest department's project. We get all support from the department and are hoping for additional income.""

Sushila Devi, another sericulturist from the area, said that silkworm cocoons are produced twice in a year, with the March-April season being the most productive.

""We can produce a quintal cocoon from a single shed that may fetch ₹800 or more for a kilogram. But the cocoons reared before the onset of winter in September-October have very low production and rates are also not lucrative. Sericulture has potential to benefit the farmers, and the government should employ experienced sericulturists as master trainers to encourage others to adopt silkworm rearing,"" said Devi, whose in-laws have been producing silkworm cocoons for the last almost 30 years.

Chatar Singh, a farmer from Bhadan village, said that last season was devastating as he was able to rear only 10 kg of cocoons.

""I own four acres of agriculture land, but it is hardly productive in the absence of sufficient irrigation facilities in the foothills. I have been working on sericulture since 2022 and got training in Jammu. I am convinced that it can bring a change in the rural areas. We hardly have any investment in projects of the forest department, but the fluctuating market rate is discouraging,"" he added.",2025-01-10,buoyed by the success of the sericulture pilot project in pathankot punjab is all set to expand silk production to the doaba belt within a year the state forest department has roped in 46 economically marginalised villagers from hoshiarpur to produce silk cocoons in 2022 as part of a pilot project to check viability of sericulture the state forest department had provided training and infrastructure to 116 villagers most of them belonging to the scheduled caste community having no or small landholdings in the underdeveloped dhar revenue block of pathankot as part of the project nearly 40000 mulberry trees were planted in pathankot with its leaves which are the only source of food for silkworms being provided to the sericulturists for free in the last two years about 6 tonnes of silk cocoon was produced in pathankot all support sheds for silkworm cultivation mulberry leaves mandi to sell reared cocoons was provided to farmers under a centrefunded project supported by bengalurubased central silk board said sanjeev tiwari conservator of forests north circle he said the silkworms for the project were purchased from west bengal karnataka and other places at least 12000 saplings have already been planted in hoshiarpur and another 10000 will be sown in the next phase said tiwari he added that in pathankot a factory to produce silk thread would also be set up in the next four to five months and it will become operational within a year villagers in the submountainous areas near the shivalik foothills known as kandi areas where conventional farming is a challenge due to constrained natural resources said that sericulture has the potential to improve their economic condition manohar lal 60 of pathankots durang khad village who owns seven kanals of land said we have small landholdings and that too in the semihilly regions which are not viable for wheat and maize cultivation i have been in sericulture for almost a decade but things improved since i got associated with the forest departments project we get all support from the department and are hoping for additional income sushila devi another sericulturist from the area said that silkworm cocoons are produced twice in a year with the marchapril season being the most productive we can produce a quintal cocoon from a single shed that may fetch 800 or more for a kilogram but the cocoons reared before the onset of winter in septemberoctober have very low production and rates are also not lucrative sericulture has potential to benefit the farmers and the government should employ experienced sericulturists as master trainers to encourage others to adopt silkworm rearing said devi whose inlaws have been producing silkworm cocoons for the last almost 30 years chatar singh a farmer from bhadan village said that last season was devastating as he was able to rear only 10 kg of cocoons i own four acres of agriculture land but it is hardly productive in the absence of sufficient irrigation facilities in the foothills i have been working on sericulture since 2022 and got training in jammu i am convinced that it can bring a change in the rural areas we hardly have any investment in projects of the forest department but the fluctuating market rate is discouraging he added,climate,0
Hollywood Guild Leaders Discuss AI's Impact on Negotiations at CES - News Directory 3,"Hollywood Unions Band Together as AI Reshapes Entertainment Industry

Fear of replacement by artificial intelligence looms large as Hollywood unions prepare for the next round of contract negotiations.

At the recent Labor Innovation & Technology Summit, held during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the prevailing sentiment among Hollywood workers was clear: AI is a real and present threat to their livelihoods.

""the fear of replacement is very real at this moment and in this room,"" said Linda Powell,EVP of SAG-AFTRA,during a panel titled ""Negotiating AI Contracts: How Unions Can Advance All Protections Across Sectors.""

Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator, acknowledged the importance of the summit's timing, coinciding with CES, a major tech conference showcasing a range of AI advancements.

""CES has helped us identify trends coming down the road and separate the wheat from the chaff"" in terms of focusing resources and energy, he said.

Crabtree-Ireland emphasized the need for ""complete clarity"" in negotiating AI contracts, citing a lesson learned when SAG-AFTRA failed to publicly release a contract with a smaller player last year.

While acknowledging the inevitability of AI's advancement, Crabtree-Ireland stressed the importance of unions leveraging their power to shape its implementation.

""We don't have the choice of stopping the technology from happening,"" he said. ""If we're going to make the most of the leverage of power that we have at unions, we can't just be against the technology. As that didn't work with the invention of electricity, or the internet, or the VCR.""

The 2023 contract negotiations for both actors and writers saw AI protections emerge as a key objective, fueled by the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which sparked widespread debate about AI's impact on society.

As hollywood gears up for the next round of negotiations, the specter of AI hangs heavy. Unions are determined to ensure that their members are not left behind in the rapidly evolving technological landscape.

The outcome of these negotiations will have far-reaching consequences for the future of work in Hollywood and beyond.

Solidarity Takes Center Stage as Directors Guild Navigates New Technological Landscape

Los Angeles, CA - The entertainment industry is facing a seismic shift with the rise of artificial intelligence. As studios and streamers increasingly explore AI's potential, Hollywood unions are working tirelessly to ensure their members' rights and livelihoods are protected in this uncharted territory.

At a recent Directors Guild of America (DGA) event, President Leslie Linka Glatter emphasized the paramount importance of solidarity among unions in navigating this new frontier.

""Solidarity doesn't begin when negotiations fail. Solidarity is something you have to work on every single day,"" Glatter stated.

This sentiment was echoed by Russell Hollander, DGA Executive Director, who highlighted the growing sense of unity within the industry.

""As the start of the pandemic, we have been on a trajectory in the entertainment industry that begins to have deeper and stronger solidarity than we ever have before,"" Hollander said.

This newfound solidarity was on full display during the 2023 strikes, where unions like SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) stood in unwavering support of the DGA, even though the directors had already reached a deal.

""They were out on the picket lines with us.Russ was personally out there multiple times,"" said DGA National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, underscoring the collaborative spirit.

The DGA is actively working to incorporate AI-related provisions into its contracts, recognizing both the potential benefits and risks of this emerging technology.

""We can't negotiate contracts on autopilot,"" Glatter said.Hollander pointed out that while many DGA members see the upside of AI, citing directors like Jon Favreau and Robert Zemeckis as examples, the union is also mindful of those who are more skeptical or even opposed to its use.

Consultation rights, a common element in collective bargaining agreements, are seen as crucial in ensuring directors have a voice in how AI is implemented.

""Contractually guaranteed consultation in terms of how AI is used is a useful protection,"" Hollander explained.

The DGA's approach to AI negotiations has been met with both support and resistance from studios and streamers.

""They push for provisions on AI to be removed,"" Crabtree-Ireland revealed, adding that studios frequently enough urge unions to ""just trust us"" when it comes to responsible AI use.

""If you say we should trust you, why don't you want to put that in writng?"" crabtree-Ireland challenged.

He emphasized the importance of holding studios accountable.

As contract negotiations approach, unions like SAG-AFTRA and the Directors Guild of America (DGA) are prioritizing the inclusion of robust AI protections. These protections aim to safeguard the livelihoods of actors, writers, directors, and other entertainment professionals. Key areas of focus include:

Informed Consent: Ensuring performers have a clear understanding of how their likenesses and performances will be used by AI.

fair Compensation: Establishing fair payment structures for the use of performers' likenesses and voices in AI-generated content.

* Ownership and Control: Protecting performers' rights to their creative output and preventing unauthorized use of their work by AI.

The DGA, such as, has been vocal in publicly calling out missteps and advocating for transparency. As the entertainment industry continues to evolve, the DGA and other unions remain committed to protecting the rights and interests of their members in the age of AI. The emphasis on solidarity and proactive negotiation will be crucial in shaping the future of filmmaking and ensuring that human creativity remains at the forefront.

Los Angeles, CA - The glitz and glamour of hollywood are facing a new reality: the rapid rise of artificial intelligence. As the entertainment industry grapples with the implications of AI, contract negotiations for both actors and writers in 2023 saw a surprising new priority emerge - protecting creative work from AI encroachment.

Fueled by the public's fascination with AI tools like ChatGPT, concerns about the technology's potential impact on the industry have reached a fever pitch. A primary fear is that AI could be trained on copyrighted material, devaluing the work of writers and actors while potentially compromising their privacy and identity.

""I joined the WGA after the landmark 2023 contract resolution,"" shared Sam Wheeler, Executive Director of the Writers Guild of America east. ""In a previous role, I underestimated the threat of AI, and it's a lesson I won't forget. We need to stay informed and proactive.""

Wheeler's words highlight the urgency felt by many in Hollywood. The 2023 negotiations marked a turning point, with unions pushing for strong safeguards against the misuse of AI.

As the dust settles on the 2023 negotiations, the industry is already looking ahead to the next round, scheduled for just over a year away. The future of work in Hollywood hangs in the balance as unions and studios navigate the complex challenges posed by AI.

Will AI become a valuable tool for creatives, or will it threaten their livelihoods? The answers will be shaped by the ongoing dialog and negotiations between Hollywood's power players. One thing is certain: the future of entertainment is being written, and AI is playing a starring role.

The outcome of these negotiations will have far-reaching consequences for the future of work in Hollywood and beyond.

The entertainment industry is facing a seismic shift with the rise of artificial intelligence. As studios and streamers increasingly explore AI's potential, Hollywood unions are working tirelessly to ensure their members' rights and livelihoods are protected in this uncharted territory.

At a recent Directors Guild of America (DGA) event, President Leslie Linka Glatter emphasized the paramount importance of solidarity among unions in navigating this new frontier.

""Solidarity doesn't begin when negotiations fail.Solidarity is something you have to work on every single day,"" Glatter stated.

this sentiment was echoed by Russell Hollander, DGA Executive Director, who highlighted the growing sense of unity within the industry.

""As the start of the pandemic, we have been on a trajectory in the entertainment industry that begins to have deeper and stronger solidarity than we ever have before,"" Hollander said.

This newfound solidarity was on full display during the 2023 strikes,where unions like SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) stood in unwavering support of the DGA,even tho the directors had already reached a deal.

""They were out on the picket lines with us.Russ was personally out there multiple times,"" said DGA National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, underscoring the collaborative spirit.

The DGA is actively working to incorporate AI-related provisions into its contracts, recognizing both the potential benefits and risks of this emerging technology.

""We can't negotiate contracts on autopilot,"" Glatter said.Hollander pointed out that while many DGA members see the upside of AI, citing directors like Jon Favreau and Robert Zemeckis as examples, the union is also mindful of those who are more skeptical or even opposed to its use.

Column-Will USDA data dump spoil the bullish party for corn? -Braun,"NAPERVILLE, Illinois (Reuters) - If anything can derail a price rally, it is a curveball from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Chicago corn futures have ticked slightly lower to start the year, but they had climbed nearly 12% in the final two months of 2024, an unusually strong late-year run.

Speculators now hold their most bullish corn view in two years, and luckily for them, the trade has already accepted that last year's U.S. corn yield was a whopper.

Friday will feature USDA's biggest data release of the year, with primary focus on the most recent U.S. corn and soybean harvests. U.S. quarterly stocks, U.S. winter wheat seedings and routine global supply and demand updates will also compete for attention.

U.S. CORN AND BEANS

On average, analysts peg U.S. corn yield at 182.7 bushels per acre, down from 183.1 in November. The trade estimate is more than 5 bushels above last year's record and above USDA's initial trendline yield for the first time in six years.

Bearish yield outcomes are less likely when the estimates are already large, and only four of 19 polled analysts see corn yield rising from November. However, the range of trade estimates (2.4 bpa) is smaller than usual, flagging the potential for surprise.

In the last decade, analysts anticipated the wrong direction of U.S. corn yield in January only once (2019). They did so three times for soybean yield (2016, 2019, 2022).

But bets are somewhat off for U.S. soybean yield outcomes because USDA's slashing of the forecast in November was the month's largest cut in 31 years. Trade estimates indicate some uncertainty around U.S. soybean production as the ranges for both yield and harvested area are historically wide.

Regardless, U.S. soybean supplies are expected to remain ample and at multi-year highs. However, USDA last month pegged 2024-25 U.S. corn ending stocks below the prior year's level for the first time.

If USDA cuts U.S. corn ending stocks on Friday as expected, it would be the agency's seventh consecutive monthly reduction. Such a streak has not been observed in at least two decades, reflective of the strong demand that has recently lifted corn prices.

From a market reaction standpoint, these demand dynamics could be somewhat insulating if the U.S. corn crop comes in larger than expected. The last two times CBOT corn had a distinctly negative reaction on January report day were 2012 and 2024, the latter sparked by a huge yield above all trade estimates.

U.S. WHEAT

USDA will not officially issue 2025-26 outlooks until May, but the wheat market will receive its first piece of 2025-26 U.S. crop intel on Friday with the winter wheat planting survey. Total U.S. winter wheat acres are pegged at 33.37 million, very close to both last year and the five-year average.

Analysts have had a rough time anticipating the planting survey in the last two years, coming in almost 1.4 million acres too high last year but lowballing by nearly 2.5 million acres in 2023.

Wheat traders have struggled to find viable bullish narratives despite wheat stocks among major exporters seen dropping to 17-year lows, so another big miss in the U.S. wheat acreage could either support or undermine the recent sentiment.

SOUTH AMERICA

The U.S. crops will probably dominate the headlines on Friday, but it is not too early to watch out for forecast changes in South America. Analysts see USDA upping Brazil's 2024-25 soybean harvest to a record 170.28 million metric tons from the previous 169 million.

USDA has increased Brazil's soy crop in three of the last eight Januarys, both on area and yield improvements, and many industry participants have already been factoring in a number north of 170 million tons.

For Argentina, there are already fears that ongoing dry weather could eventually warrant more significant cuts to soybean and corn crops than are anticipated for Friday. American and European weather model runs on Thursday remained stingy with the rainfall over the next two weeks.

USDA already hiked Argentina's soybean output last month on higher area. The agency increased the crop last January but reduced it in the prior three Januarys. Current crop conditions are slightly worse than a year ago but better than in the prior three years.

Gut Health And Digestion As You Age: Nurturing Your Body from Within,"Gut health refers to the balance and functioning of the GI tract, which is highly critical in overall well-being

GI tract does its task of digestion by breaking down the food, absorbing the nutrients, and expelling waste through the gut. The importance, however, lies beyond digestion. As scientists have often referred to the gut as the ""second brain,"" it contains a complex network of neurons that influence mood, immunity, and even cognitive function. The gut is an important gateway for longevity and quality of life, especially in the aged population.

As we age especially post 40, gut health becomes paramount due to its reciprocal effect on nutritional absorption and immune response. Aging related gut impairment like reduced speed of digestion, a decrease in stomach acid, and changed gut microbiota composition may cause gastrointestinal disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and inflammation. A healthy gut would contribute to proper digestion, absorption of nutrients, and protective functions against chronic diseases for improved quality of life.

Starting from birth and as we age, there is a sequence of changes in the digestive system that has adverse effects on gut health. The most important change involves a decrease in the production of stomach acid, which is important for digestion and the absorption of vital nutrients like vitamin B12, calcium, and iron. Because of impaired digestion, this can be followed by nutrient deficiencies that weaken the immune response. Besides this, digestion also slows down because of the reduction in tone within the gastrointestinal tract muscles, hence leading to symptoms of constipation and bloating. Gut microbiota is impaired with aging, leading to a reduction in their diversity and an increase in pathogenic bacteria, promoting inflammation and reducing gut protection against pathogens. These features together lead to poor digestive efficiency and deficient nutrient absorption, thereby contributing to poor gut health. These gradually lead to indigestion, abnormal bowel movements, and even to serious disorders, such as metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and immune system disorders.

Adequate intake of fiber, probiotics, and prebiotics will help in maintaining good gut health, especially at an older age. Probiotics are 'friendly' living bacteria contained in fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, and commercial preparations. Consuming probiotics replaces and helps maintain the good balance of gut bacteria necessary for healthy digestion and absorption of nutrients. Prebiotics are forms of non-digestible fibers that feed the bacteria lining the colon. Prebiotics are those substances mainly supplied by food items, including onions, garlic, bananas, and asparagus, which favor the growth of probiotics.

Fiber helps regulate bowel movements and supports the colon's population of friendly bacteria. Fiber in whole grains like Oats, whole wheat bran, quinoa, are some examples of fibre-rich whole grain food products.

One can opt for Right Shift products which is exclusively curated for 40+ individuals. Right Shift Oats ++, Millet Masala Oats, Right Shift multi-grain flour etc are designed to improve gut health and contains a combination of millets, nuts, grains, which helps prevent constipation and keeps the gut microbiome healthy.

While aging is an unstoppable process, some dietary options can take good care of the gut and overall health of a person. Food rich in fiber content, along with probiotic-rich items added to one's diet, can lessen the impact brought about by aging.

Banana venture transforms villagers' lives,"SMALL-SCALE banana farming in parts of Chipinge has proved to be a life-saver under extremely hot weather conditions.

SMALL-SCALE banana farming in parts of Chipinge has proved to be a life-saver under extremely hot weather conditions.

Previously thousands of hectares of irrigated land was lying idle in Chibuwe and Mutema areas.

The idea to start irrigation schemes in low-lying areas of Chipinge with crops such as wheat, beans, onions, tomatoes and maize was mooted long before the country's independence.

The market was readily available too and horticulture has been a source of livelihood for many over the years.

However, in recent years the irrigation infrastructure in these parts of the country suffered a major knock from vandalism and ill-serviced equipment which was also heavily damaged by the destructive Cyclone Eline in 2000.

As a result, thousands of hectares of arable land was getting under-utilised with calls from farmers to get government assistance falling on deaf ears.

But of late, things have been improving since the introduction of the multi-currency system in 2009 and farmers have been able to put small pieces of land under irrigation.

Several aid partners have been willing to rescue thousands of struggling villagers with one such partner Matanuska, a giant export quality banana-producing company, introducing small-scale programmes with 100 hectares of banana farming in both Chibuwe and Mutema.

Matanuska is in partnership with the United States Aid for International Development's Zimbabwe Agricultural Income and Employment Development (Zim-AIED) in this programme with a total of 438 beneficiaries reaping profits from the scheme.

""In the Mutema area, we have 60 hectors under banana irrigation scheme with 238 farmers on board,"" explained Naume Mayakayaka, an Agritex supervisor in Mutema.

""The programme started off in 2012 and farmers have harvested three times now and on average they pocket $300 a month. ""We have two types of varieties which are Asdia and Sweet Williams which have a foreign ready foreign market in countries such as Zambia and South Africa.

""However, at first the farmers were hesitant to join the programme because they feared the loans, but after a series of meetings and demonstrations, they embraced it and now they are enjoying profits,"" explained Mayakayaka.

Minister of State for Manicaland province Chris Mushohwe applauded the working relationship between the locals and Matanuska, saying more positive partnerships should yield from this scheme.

""A lot of programmes have been approved in this area and recently Vice-President Joice Mujuru endorsed your sugar cane plantation programme. I hope you are learning skills from such partnerships with Matanuska,"" said Mushohwe.

""Matanuska came to my office in 2009 complaining that their banana plantations were being taken over and it was affecting their market. I asked them whether they were in a position to support the locals and I also tasked them to look for different places in Manicaland where they were going to partner locals.""

Mushohwe urged farmers to take banana farming as a fully-fledged business.

""I am happy that the locals are assuming ownership of the programme. I urge you to take this as a serious business and know that it is a not for free. Desist from giving people bananas for free because you will not go anywhere,"" he said.

Matanuska project co-ordinator Johannes Makurumidze said the project has mutually beneficial to the company and the locals. ""The banana project has created a win-win situation for both the company and the locals here and we are expecting the produces to be the best in Africa as we aim to achieve 60 tonnes per hector under irrigation,"" he said.

Makurumidze said farmers now have more disposable income and could now fund production of other crops such as sugar beans. ""Generally there has been an increase in economic activities in Mutema and Chibuwe,"" he said.

""People are building houses and more children are going to school while transport business is thriving too. We are also happy that there is now increased food security in that farmers can buy and store food.""

Makurumidze added that other partners such as CABS Bank have also come aboard and are giving loans using the banana crops as security.

He said the project has managed to improve the irrigation in the area while also giving technical support and skills transfer to the villagers.

Makurumidze, however, bemoaned high rates charged by the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) and Zesa power utility saying it is not doing any good to the farmers.

Farmers told NewsDay that their lives were changing for the better because of banana farming. They said banana production was unlike sugar beans farming which is failing to attract a lucrative market for them.

""We used to struggle to pay school fees and uniforms for our children and there is a high rate of drop outs here in Mutema because we didn't have money to finance schooling for children,"" said one farmer Mathias Chijokwe.

""But now we are in a position to surpass that and even go a step further of building good houses and ablution facilities. We hope this project will spread to other nearby communities because we view ourselves as one family.""

He pleaded with the government to replace old and dilapidated water pumps in Mutema.

According to the extension officers, more women have shown interest in the project than men and according to their records more women are excelling than men.

Women farmers said banana farming has changed their lives. Some said they managed to build houses, buy groceries and are managing to pay school fees for their children as well as venture into other income generating projects.

Egness Phiri said together with her elderly mother-in-law they were getting enough money to lead a decent life. They have since managed to transform their lifestyles from living in grass-thatched mud houses to brick houses under asbestos.

""We are staying in region five which has extremely hot temperatures, but instead of focusing on our poverty we got into banana farming and we have enough to eat, living a life of our own and sponsoring our children's schooling and paying for medicals,"" said Phiri.

Implementers of the project said farmers are now in a position to pay off their loans as well as servicing Zesa and Zinwa bills.",2025-01-10,smallscale banana farming in parts of chipinge has proved to be a lifesaver under extremely hot weather conditions smallscale banana farming in parts of chipinge has proved to be a lifesaver under extremely hot weather conditions previously thousands of hectares of irrigated land was lying idle in chibuwe and mutema areas the idea to start irrigation schemes in lowlying areas of chipinge with crops such as wheat beans onions tomatoes and maize was mooted long before the countrys independence the market was readily available too and horticulture has been a source of livelihood for many over the years however in recent years the irrigation infrastructure in these parts of the country suffered a major knock from vandalism and illserviced equipment which was also heavily damaged by the destructive cyclone eline in 2000 as a result thousands of hectares of arable land was getting underutilised with calls from farmers to get government assistance falling on deaf ears but of late things have been improving since the introduction of the multicurrency system in 2009 and farmers have been able to put small pieces of land under irrigation several aid partners have been willing to rescue thousands of struggling villagers with one such partner matanuska a giant export quality bananaproducing company introducing smallscale programmes with 100 hectares of banana farming in both chibuwe and mutema matanuska is in partnership with the united states aid for international developments zimbabwe agricultural income and employment development zimaied in this programme with a total of 438 beneficiaries reaping profits from the scheme in the mutema area we have 60 hectors under banana irrigation scheme with 238 farmers on board explained naume mayakayaka an agritex supervisor in mutema the programme started off in 2012 and farmers have harvested three times now and on average they pocket 300 a month we have two types of varieties which are asdia and sweet williams which have a foreign ready foreign market in countries such as zambia and south africa however at first the farmers were hesitant to join the programme because they feared the loans but after a series of meetings and demonstrations they embraced it and now they are enjoying profits explained mayakayaka minister of state for manicaland province chris mushohwe applauded the working relationship between the locals and matanuska saying more positive partnerships should yield from this scheme a lot of programmes have been approved in this area and recently vicepresident joice mujuru endorsed your sugar cane plantation programme i hope you are learning skills from such partnerships with matanuska said mushohwe matanuska came to my office in 2009 complaining that their banana plantations were being taken over and it was affecting their market i asked them whether they were in a position to support the locals and i also tasked them to look for different places in manicaland where they were going to partner locals mushohwe urged farmers to take banana farming as a fullyfledged business i am happy that the locals are assuming ownership of the programme i urge you to take this as a serious business and know that it is a not for free desist from giving people bananas for free because you will not go anywhere he said matanuska project coordinator johannes makurumidze said the project has mutually beneficial to the company and the locals the banana project has created a winwin situation for both the company and the locals here and we are expecting the produces to be the best in africa as we aim to achieve 60 tonnes per hector under irrigation he said makurumidze said farmers now have more disposable income and could now fund production of other crops such as sugar beans generally there has been an increase in economic activities in mutema and chibuwe he said people are building houses and more children are going to school while transport business is thriving too we are also happy that there is now increased food security in that farmers can buy and store food makurumidze added that other partners such as cabs bank have also come aboard and are giving loans using the banana crops as security he said the project has managed to improve the irrigation in the area while also giving technical support and skills transfer to the villagers makurumidze however bemoaned high rates charged by the zimbabwe national water authority zinwa and zesa power utility saying it is not doing any good to the farmers farmers told newsday that their lives were changing for the better because of banana farming they said banana production was unlike sugar beans farming which is failing to attract a lucrative market for them we used to struggle to pay school fees and uniforms for our children and there is a high rate of drop outs here in mutema because we didnt have money to finance schooling for children said one farmer mathias chijokwe but now we are in a position to surpass that and even go a step further of building good houses and ablution facilities we hope this project will spread to other nearby communities because we view ourselves as one family he pleaded with the government to replace old and dilapidated water pumps in mutema according to the extension officers more women have shown interest in the project than men and according to their records more women are excelling than men women farmers said

"Manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors: FBR to bring FMCG sector into digital invoicing  system","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has decided to bring Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors into the Digital Invoicing System (DIS) across the country.

Under the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the FBR's Transformation Plan would be implemented and almost ten thousand FMCGs would be linked with DIS as a complete chain. This DIS will not be implemented at the retail stage but the manufacturers and wholesalers will be brought into the DIS to gauge effective monitoring of the Sales Tax and making efforts to avoid massive leakages in the tax system.

The FBR has already linked tier-1 retailers with the Point of Sale (PoS), however, this system has so far remained unable to make it an effective system to plug leakages.

The FBR has also overhauled PoS for hotels/restaurants located in the federal capital and introduced a pilot project which entails that if they issue any fake receipt, prizes will be given to complainant.

The DIS will be put in place for different FMCG including wheat flour mills, beverages, food items and other bakery items. The FBR intends to place this system at manufacturer and wholesale levels with the purpose to gauge their actual sale and plug billions of rupees tax evasion on per annum basis.

Meanwhile, the FBR has sought suggestion from relevant stakeholders for preparation of the upcoming budget for 2025-26. It is aimed at seeking proposals for broadening of tax base for a wider participation in revenue generation efforts, policy suggestions for bringing entire value chain of all businesses in GST regime, promoting progressive taxation by introducing various measures where incidence of tax is higher on affluent classes, phasing out of tax concessions and exemptions under all tax laws, facilitation of taxpayers and ease of doing business by removal of redundancy and simplification of tax laws, measures to reduce tax arbitrage opportunities and infuse efficiency in economy by following neutrality principle in taxation and removal of tax distortions, procedural lapses and anomalies.",2025-01-10,islamabad the federal board of revenue fbr has decided to bring fast moving consumer goods fmcg manufacturers wholesalers and distributors into the digital invoicing system dis across the country under the directives of prime minister shehbaz sharif the fbrs transformation plan would be implemented and almost ten thousand fmcgs would be linked with dis as a complete chain this dis will not be implemented at the retail stage but the manufacturers and wholesalers will be brought into the dis to gauge effective monitoring of the sales tax and making efforts to avoid massive leakages in the tax system the fbr has already linked tier1 retailers with the point of sale pos however this system has so far remained unable to make it an effective system to plug leakages the fbr has also overhauled pos for hotelsrestaurants located in the federal capital and introduced a pilot project which entails that if they issue any fake receipt prizes will be given to complainant the dis will be put in place for different fmcg including wheat flour mills beverages food items and other bakery items the fbr intends to place this system at manufacturer and wholesale levels with the purpose to gauge their actual sale and plug billions of rupees tax evasion on per annum basis meanwhile the fbr has sought suggestion from relevant stakeholders for preparation of the upcoming budget for 202526 it is aimed at seeking proposals for broadening of tax base for a wider participation in revenue generation efforts policy suggestions for bringing entire value chain of all businesses in gst regime promoting progressive taxation by introducing various measures where incidence of tax is higher on affluent classes phasing out of tax concessions and exemptions under all tax laws facilitation of taxpayers and ease of doing business by removal of redundancy and simplification of tax laws measures to reduce tax arbitrage opportunities and infuse efficiency in economy by following neutrality principle in taxation and removal of tax distortions procedural lapses and anomalies,climate,0
Maryam formally launches livestock card,"PAKPATTAN/LAHORE: Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz has formally launched the first-ever livestock card in Pakistan's history.

During a ceremony in Pakpattan on Thursday, she distributed the 'Chief Minister Livestock Cards' to farmers. On her arrival, the farmers welcomed her with a grand reception, featuring traditional horse dances performed to the rhythm of drums and flutes.

The chief minister interacted with farmers, who shared their thoughts on the utility of livestock card. She also met with assembly members from the Sahiwal division, who praised her for fulfilling the dreams and aspirations of Punjab's farming community.

Provincial Minister for Livestock and Dairy Development Ashiq Hussain highlighted that record progress has been made in the agriculture and livestock sectors in the past year. Through the livestock card, farmers will receive interest-free loans for four months, amounting to Rs27,000 per animal. A total of Rs4.4 billion have been allocated for the programme, with plans to distribute Rs11 billion to 15,000 farmers over two years. The Feedlot Programme aims to include 400,000 livestock within the same period.

Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also inaugurated several road projects in Pakpattan, built at a cost of over Rs8 billion. ""These roads will benefit millions by facilitating transportation and boosting economic activities in the region,"" she said. ""These projects will improve access to Motorway M-3, Bahawalnagar, and Qabula while enhancing infrastructure in Pakpattan and surrounding districts.""

Speaking at the livestock card launch, Maryam Nawaz emphasized the government's commitment to public welfare: ""We are committed to realising the vision of Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif. Public funds are now being utilised for the people's benefit.""

The chief minister also highlighted Punjab's achievements in wheat production, livestock vaccination and economic recovery.

""Pakistan's economy is stabilising, inflation is decreasing and microeconomic indicators are improving. The Punjab government remains focused on reducing flour and bread prices to support the common man,"" she added.

The chief minister expressed her commitment to modernising the livestock sector. She announced that 90,000 additional livestock cards would be distributed next year, with the scope of the programme set to expand. ""Through the livestock card, we aim to meet domestic needs and export quality meat and milk. Investments from Gulf countries are also pouring into the livestock sector,"" she said.

Reflecting on her leadership journey, CM Maryam Nawaz expressed gratitude for the guidance of Nawaz Sharif and pledged to continue working for the betterment of Pakistanis.

""Punjab's farmers are thriving, and their prosperity speaks volumes about our efforts. We remain steadfast in our commitment to fulfilling promises and addressing the needs of the people,"" she said.

The Punjab chief minister, without naming her political opponents, said that ""those who, when they step up, rise against the country, and when they open their mouths, utter indecent remarks and abuses, have foot-and-mouth disease. We will not only treat animal diseases but also treat the diseases that many political parties have.""

"Hollywood Labor Leaders At CES Discuss How Their AI Negotiating Strategy Will Ease Members' ""Fear Of Replacement"" And The Importance Of Sticking Together","It didn't take long into a key Labor Innovation & Technology Summit panel before the prevailing sentiment among Hollywood workers was given voice.

""The fear of replacement is very real at this moment and in this room,"" said Linda Powell, EVP of SAG-AFTRA and moderator of the session, titled ""Negotiating AI Contracts: How Unions Can Advance All Protections Across Sectors.""

Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator, noted the positioning of the LIT Summit during CES, the major tech confab where a range of AI wares are on display. ""CES has helped us identify trends coming down the road and separate the wheat from the chaff"" in terms of focusing resources and energy, he said. NFTs, he noted, ""were the last thing everyone was freaking out about"" but labor leaders were able to see it lose steam among the technorati.

""Complete transparency"" is crucial when negotiating AI contracts, Crabtree-Ireland emphasized. Case in point, when contracts are hammered out, even with smaller players, the final version is published online, a lesson he learned when SAG-AFTRA failed to do so last year.

On a more conceptual level, Crabtree-Ireland said, ""we don't have the choice of stopping the technology from happening."" He continued, ""If we're going to make the most of the leverage of power that we have at unions, we can't just be against the technology. Because that didn't work with the invention of electricity, or the internet, or the VCR.""

In 2023, both actors and writers made AI protections a key objective in their bargaining, fueled by the introduction of OpenAI's updated version of ChatGPT, which kicked off debate across society and in business about its impact. The overriding concern in the already-battered entertainment business is that IP could be used to train AI, diluting the value of creative work and compromising the privacy and identity of individual members of the creative community. While a large portion of the panel centered on takeaways from the 2023 talks, the session also assessed the stances being assumed ahead of the next round, which will arrive in a little more than a year.

Sam Wheeler, Writers Guild of America East Executive Director, offered a ""disclaimer"" that he started at the WGA in April 2024, months after its watershed contract resolution. He also confessed to having gotten ""egg on my face"" in his prior position with a large ballet union, minimizing the threat to members, only to see the unsettling results when one of the members fed images and video of dancers into an AI-driven application. That experience reminded him of the importance of continually reading the room and understanding members' perspectives. ""We can't negotiate contracts on autopilot,"" he said.

Russell Hollander, DGA Executive Director said many members see upside in AI technology, citing Jon Favreau and Robert Zemeckis as two examples. Even so, he said, negotiations seek to cover AI skeptics or even outright opponents in the ranks. Consultation rights, a common provision in collective bargaining agreements designed to protect directors, are sometimes thought of as a minor element in the overall scheme of things, but contractually guaranteed consultation in terms of how AI is used is a useful protection, he said.

Crabtree-Ireland drew applause from the crowd by expressing disdain for the urging of studios and streamers to ""just trust us"" when it comes to responsible use of AI. After saying that to unions, he said, they push for provisions on AI to be removed. ""If you say we should trust you, why don't you want to put that in writing?"" he asked. One of the takeaways from 2023, he added, was how well it worked to ""call them out publicly"" when studios and streamers made missteps with AI.

Powell raised the topic of solidarity, which was a major theme during the 2023 strikes as well as the leadup to them. ""If we can determine that there are common priorities, signaling that far in advance of negotiations with the employers helps whatever union is up first to achieve that because they know it's important to the other unions,"" Hollander said. ""Solidarity doesn't begin when negotiations fail. Solidarity is something you have to work on every single day.""

Crabtree-Ireland said things have been progressing well on the solidarity front. ""Since the start of the pandemic, we have been on a trajectory in the entertainment industry that begins to have deeper and stronger solidarity than we ever have before. And that's not to say that it's perfect, and it's not to say that mistakes don't get made. ... But the type of communication and collaboration that we have has served our members well.""

The DGA, he noted, had reached a deal before SAG-AFTRA and WGA did. Even so, ""they were out on the picket lines with us. Russ was personally out there multiple times.""",2025-01-10,it didnt take long into a key labor innovation technology summit panel before the prevailing sentiment among hollywood workers was given voice the fear of replacement is very real at this moment and in this room said linda powell evp of sagaftra and moderator of the session titled negotiating ai contracts how unions can advance all protections across sectors duncan crabtreeireland sagaftras national executive director chief negotiator noted the positioning of the lit summit during ces the major tech confab where a range of ai wares are on display ces has helped us identify trends coming down the road and separate the wheat from the chaff in terms of focusing resources and energy he said nfts he noted were the last thing everyone was freaking out about but labor leaders were able to see it lose steam among the technorati complete transparency is crucial when negotiating ai contracts crabtreeireland emphasized case in point when contracts are hammered out even with smaller players the final version is published online a lesson he learned when sagaftra failed to do so last year on a more conceptual level crabtreeireland said we dont have the choice of stopping the technology from happening he continued if were going to make the most of the leverage of power that we have at unions we cant just be against the technology because that didnt work with the invention of electricity or the internet or the vcr in 2023 both actors and writers made ai protections a key objective in their bargaining fueled by the introduction of openais updated version of chatgpt which kicked off debate across society and in business about its impact the overriding concern in the alreadybattered entertainment business is that ip could be used to train ai diluting the value of creative work and compromising the privacy and identity of individual members of the creative community while a large portion of the panel centered on takeaways from the 2023 talks the session also assessed the stances being assumed ahead of the next round which will arrive in a little more than a year sam wheeler writers guild of america east executive director offered a disclaimer that he started at the wga in april 2024 months after its watershed contract resolution he also confessed to having gotten egg on my face in his prior position with a large ballet union minimizing the threat to members only to see the unsettling results when one of the members fed images and video of dancers into an aidriven application that experience reminded him of the importance of continually reading the room and understanding members perspectives we cant negotiate contracts on autopilot he said russell hollander dga executive director said many members see upside in ai technology citing jon favreau and robert zemeckis as two examples even so he said negotiations seek to cover ai skeptics or even outright opponents in the ranks consultation rights a common provision in collective bargaining agreements designed to protect directors are sometimes thought of as a minor element in the overall scheme of things but contractually guaranteed consultation in terms of how ai is used is a useful protection he said crabtreeireland drew applause from the crowd by expressing disdain for the urging of studios and streamers to just trust us when it comes to responsible use of ai after saying that to unions he said they push for provisions on ai to be removed if you say we should trust you why dont you want to put that in writing he asked one of the takeaways from 2023 he added was how well it worked to call them out publicly when studios and streamers made missteps with ai powell raised the topic of solidarity which was a major theme during the 2023 strikes as well as the leadup to them if we can determine that there are common priorities signaling that far in advance of negotiations with the employers helps whatever union is up first to achieve that because they know its important to the other unions hollander said solidarity doesnt begin when negotiations fail solidarity is something you have to work on every single day crabtreeireland said things have been progressing well on the solidarity front since the start of the pandemic we have been on a trajectory in the entertainment industry that begins to have deeper and stronger solidarity than we ever have before and thats not to say that its perfect and its not to say that mistakes dont get made but the type of communication and collaboration that we have has served our members well the dga he noted had reached a deal before sagaftra and wga did even so they were out on the picket lines with us russ was personally out there multiple times,climate,0
Yorkshire farmer assembles a pair of tine drills for £10k - Farmers Weekly,"Yorkshire farmer assembles a pair of tine drills for £10k Adam Clarke 08 January 2025 >More in Cereal drillsCultivation and drillingFarm maintenanceMachineryWorkshop skills Karl White © Adam Clarke

Recent autumn drilling campaigns have been a real slog for crop producers, with periods of extreme weather limiting work windows and leading to poor establishment.

And that's all the more galling when you've spent big on a drill and the associated inputs - labour, diesel and wearing metal - to get seed safely in the ground.

See more:

These pressures are forcing many farmers to reassess their establishment systems in an effort to find something that is reliable, relatively low risk, and cost effective in a range of soil types and conditions.

Among them is Karl White, who runs a mixed beef and arable unit on the edge of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, alongside his father Stephen and son Jake.

Farm facts: JC White & Son, Dodworth, Barnsley, Yorkshire Farm size 225ha, predominantly heavy clay Cropping Wheat, barley and beans, plus 40ha of grass for equine haylage Livestock 120 barley-fed store cattle for a local farm shop Staff Karl, father Stephen and son Jake, plus one other during peak periods Heavy land

Wheat, barley and beans are grown on heavy clay land, and in sticky years, the plough and power harrow combi drill system favoured by his father for decades remains the most reliable method of establishment.

However, it's time consuming and expensive, as the ground has to be worked down after ploughing, then drilled - a process that involves at least three people.

A tine drill seemed the obvious solution but, rather than shelling out up to £40,000 on a brand-new machine, he decided to have a go at putting his own together.

He already had a suitable donor - a 3m pig tine cultivator purchased from an online auction for £500.

This was originally earmarked for use post-combining to lightly scratch stubbles and encourage a chit of weeds for spraying off.

With some inspiration from his agronomist, Andrew Kealey, he set about transforming it into a drill by mounting a trusty Accord hopper and the associated pipes, seed boots and land wheel-driven metering system.

Not one for technical drawings, Karl simply made a mental plan before attacking the metalwork.

The trickiest part, he says, was working out how to fit the drilling kit on the cultivator's frame.

For starters, the headstock needed beefing up to handle the extra weight, and he had to ensure there was enough space to avoid the pto shaft, which drives the fan, clashing with the frame when lifting and lowering.

There was also a bit of jiggling required to maintain access to the bottom of the metering unit for emptying the tank.

Lightweight roller

The drill has 13 tines on 230mm rows, with these finished by a light coil packer rather than a heavy roller that would be liable to overconsolidate the soil, leading to capping.

This still firms the ground up enough for decent seed-to-soil contact and minimal slug risk, but the star-type cleaners fitted aren't always up to the job of keeping the roller free of debris.

""Conditions have been atrocious over the past couple of seasons and that sometimes causes the centre of the coil roller to bung up, so that's one thing I'll definitely change - I don't want to be getting out to clean it.

""Someone suggested a Guttler-type roller, but I think that might be a bit heavy,"" says Karl.

One modification already completed is the addition of wheel track eradicators, with four leading tines taken from a recently acquired 6m Simba Freeflow and mounted behind the wheels on the front of the frame to maintain a uniform sowing depth.

Comparable yield

The drill covered about 180ha in 2023, sowing most of the barley and wheat, and some beans, directly into stubble in combination with a front-mounted Kongskilde Terra Disc.

Happily, a side-by-side comparison in a field of wheat showed no significant yield difference compared with the usual plough and power harrow combination system.

Autumn 2024 was a slightly different story, with the old regime called into action to deal with the ruts left from a wet harvest, and heavy rain from early September.

""We had to turn land over in places to get it to drain, so we went through with the power harrow combination drills we have.

""But where the tine drill was used, it worked well - I was doing 16-20ha a day, and I could do a couple of days on a single tank of fuel, so it saved significant costs.""

More capacity

As successful as that setup was, Karl decided he needed to go bigger in order to cram as much drilling as possible into increasingly short weather windows.

He tracked down a Simba Freeflow for sale locally for just £2,000 but, at 6m, his John Deere 6210R wasn't going to be powerful enough to pull it - especially on his steepest fields.

So he set about chopping it to a more manageable width, something that proved more complex than expected.

His original plan to lop a metre off each folding wing was scuppered when he realised that it would involve a lot of work and expense, as the folding rams on the front and rear platforms would need replacing with shorter alternatives.

So, instead, he went to the narrowest width possible without interfering with the ram pivots - 4.8m - by cutting 500mm out of each folding frame.

But he did have to reposition the rams that pressurise the rear tyre packer and control seeding depth, moving them to the outside of each wing.

A piece of box section, reinforced with some 12mm steel plate, was welded to the outside of the frame to accommodate their mounts.

Reconfigured packer

Perhaps the trickiest part, though, was chopping down both the steel rollers that sit behind the machine's leading tines, and the tyre packers at the back.

The front roller had to be cut in a way that ensured the welded roller fins aligned with the home-made winged leading tines, the latter designed to work about 150mm deep and lift any surface compaction out of the seeding zone.

The scraper system also needed a slight rejig to ensure it didn't clash with the roller fins.

When it came to the packer, the back actor of Karl's JCB 3CX was used to strip the stubborn old tyres off the shaft, ready for it to be cut it down.

Replacement rubber came from Newark-based Tanvic Tyres, with various width of forklift tyres used to match the length of the truncated shaft.

The final major alteration was to the hopper. As Karl decided to set the drill up on wider rows than it was originally designed for - 21 tine coulters at 200mm spacings - a good number of the hopper outlets were redundant and blocked off.

Left as it was, there was a danger that some coulters wouldn't be fed if seed ran down unevenly, so Karl split the tank with some mild steel sheet and shifted all the pipework to the foremost outlets.

As slugs are an issue on his heavy ground, the idea is to use the slightly smaller rear half of the hopper to apply pellets during drilling, with a Y splitter combining them with the seed just before the boot.

Challenging project

The Freeflow project took about three months to complete and cost a total of £5,500 - the most expensive items being the new forklift tyres on the short rear packer sections.

Wet weather meant it wasn't involved in the autumn drilling campaign, but it has been used to sow some cover crops.

""It should allow us to get on a lot quicker - we could probably cover 40ha a day on some farms.

""We're a bit restricted by our field sizes here - some are only 2ha - but it'll easily do our biggest 20ha field in a day plus a bit more, so I'm quite happy with how it's turned out,"" Karl concludes.

08 january 2025 more in cereal drillscultivation and drillingfarm maintenancemachineryworkshop skills karl white adam clarke recent autumn drilling campaigns have been a real slog for crop producers with periods of extreme weather limiting work windows and leading to poor establishment and thats all the more galling when youve spent big on a drill and the associated inputs labour diesel and wearing metal to get seed safely in the ground see more these pressures are forcing many farmers to reassess their establishment systems in an effort to find something that is reliable relatively low risk and cost effective in a range of soil types and conditions among them is karl white who runs a mixed beef and arable unit on the edge of barnsley south yorkshire alongside his father stephen and son jake farm facts jc white son dodworth barnsley yorkshire farm size 225ha predominantly heavy clay cropping wheat barley and beans plus 40ha of grass for equine haylage livestock 120 barleyfed store cattle for a local farm shop staff karl father stephen and son jake plus one other during peak periods heavy land wheat barley and beans are grown on heavy clay land and in sticky years the plough and power harrow combi drill system favoured by his father for decades remains the most reliable method of establishment however its time consuming and expensive as the ground has to be worked down after ploughing then drilled a process that involves at least three people a tine drill seemed the obvious solution but rather than shelling out up to 40000 on a brandnew machine he decided to have a go at putting his own together he already had a suitable donor a 3m pig tine cultivator purchased from an online auction for 500 this was originally earmarked for use postcombining to lightly scratch stubbles and encourage a chit of weeds for spraying off with some inspiration from his agronomist andrew kealey he set about transforming it into a drill by mounting a trusty accord hopper and the associated pipes seed boots and land wheeldriven metering system not one for technical drawings karl simply made a mental plan before attacking the metalwork the trickiest part he says was working out how to fit the drilling kit on the cultivators frame for starters the headstock needed beefing up to handle the extra weight and he had to ensure there was enough space to avoid the pto shaft which drives the fan clashing with the frame when lifting and lowering there was also a bit of jiggling required to maintain access to the bottom of the metering unit for emptying the tank adam clarke lightweight roller the drill has 13 tines on 230mm rows with these finished by a light coil packer rather than a heavy roller that would be liable to overconsolidate the soil leading to capping this still firms the ground up enough for decent seedtosoil contact and minimal slug risk but the startype cleaners fitted arent always up to the job of keeping the roller free of debris conditions have been atrocious over the past couple of seasons and that sometimes causes the centre of the coil roller to bung up so thats one thing ill definitely change i dont want to be getting out to clean it someone suggested a guttlertype roller but i think that might be a bit heavy says karl one modification already completed is the addition of wheel track eradicators with four leading tines taken from a recently acquired 6m simba freeflow and mounted behind the wheels on the front of the frame to maintain a uniform sowing depth comparable yield the drill covered about 180ha in 2023 sowing most of the barley and wheat and some beans directly into stubble in combination with a frontmounted kongskilde terra disc happily a sidebyside comparison in a field of wheat showed no significant yield difference compared with the usual plough and power harrow combination system autumn 2024 was a slightly different story with the old regime called into action to deal with the ruts left from a wet harvest and heavy rain from early september we had to turn land over in places to get it to drain so we went through with the power harrow combination drills we have but where the tine drill was used it worked well i was doing 1620ha a day and i could do a couple of days on a single tank of fuel so it saved significant costs more capacity as successful as that setup was karl decided he needed to go bigger in order to cram as much drilling as possible into increasingly short weather windows he tracked down a simba freeflow for sale locally for just 2000 but at 6m his john deere 6210r wasnt going to be powerful enough to pull it especially on his steepest fields so he set about chopping it to a more manageable width something that proved more complex than expected his original plan to lop a metre off each folding wing was scuppered when he realised that it would involve a lot of work and expense as the folding rams on the front and rear platforms would need replacing with shorter alternatives so instead he went to the narrowest width possible without interfering with the ram pivots 48m by cutting 500mm out of each folding frame but he did have to reposition the rams that pressurise the rear tyre packer and control seeding depth moving them to the outside of each wing a piece of box section reinforced with some 12mm steel plate was welded to the outside of the frame to accommodate their mounts adam clarke reconfigured packer perhaps the trickiest part though was chopping down both the steel rollers that sit behind the machines leading tines and the tyre packers at the back the front roller had to be cut in a way that ensured the welded roller fins aligned with the homemade winged leading tines the latter designed to work about 150mm deep and lift any surface compaction out of the seeding zone the scraper system also needed a slight rejig to ensure it didnt clash with the roller fins when it came to the packer the back actor of karls jcb 3cx was used to strip the stubborn old tyres off the shaft ready for it to be cut it down replacement rubber came from newarkbased tanvic tyres with various width of forklift tyres used to match the length of the truncated shaft the final major alteration was to the hopper as karl decided to set the drill up on wider rows than it was originally designed for 21 tine coulters at 200mm spacings a good number of the hopper outlets were redundant and blocked off left as it was there was a danger that some coulters wouldnt be fed if seed ran down unevenly so karl split the tank with some mild steel sheet and shifted all the pipework to the foremost outlets as slugs are an issue on his heavy ground the idea is to use the slightly smaller rear half of the hopper to apply pellets during drilling with a y splitter combining them with the seed just before the boot challenging project the freeflow project took about three months to complete and cost a total of 5500 the most expensive items being the new forklift tyres on the short rear packer sections wet weather meant it wasnt involved in the autumn drilling campaign but it has been used to sow some cover crops it should allow us to get on a lot quicker we could probably cover 40ha a day on some farms were a bit restricted by our field sizes here some are only 2ha but itll easily do our biggest 20ha field in a day plus a bit more so im quite

The Drought That Felled Assad - OpEd,"The meteorological drought that swept through the Fertile Crescent (stretching from the Tigris and Euphrates to the Nile Valley) in the 2000s finally ended up undoing the Assad regime in Syria and forcing Bashar al-Assad to flee to Moscow under the cover of night last month. At first glance, drought or its driver in climate change seems to have little to do with a geopolitical event like the fall of the Assad regime. However, the fall of the regime has been years in the making, and climate-related issues played a large role.

The decline of the Assad regime began with a protracted drought in 1998, the likes of which the Middle East had not seen in the past nine centuries. The drought's severity reached its peak in 2006-2011 in northeastern Syria, which is the country's breadbasket, comprising the Euphrates and Jazira regions. These regions produce two-thirds of the country's crop yield, especially Syria's staple, wheat.

At its peak, the drought caused agriculture, the green anchor of the Syrian economy, to collapse. Agricultural production, which generates one-fourth of the country's GDP, dropped to 17 percent. But this aggregate impact doesn't capture the devastation it wrought on millions of rural residents, farmers, and herders whose individual farm production fell to zero or near-zero. Syria, which was the only country in the Fertile Crescent (Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine) that was self-sufficient in foodgrain production, became an importer of wheat in 2008.

Hafez al-Assad, Bashar al-Assad's father, who ruled the country from 1971 to 2000, founded his reign on Baathist socialist ideology. He helped expand agriculture by subsidizing the ever-growing cost of farm inputs and even insuring against the crop failures that were frequent in the dryland agricultural system. State subsidies buffered millions of rural residents, farmers, and herders against unexpected meteorological and market-driven shocks. His son, on the other hand, reversed all that. Introducing neoliberal policies, Bashar al-Assad left everyone on their own. On his watch, capital-rich farmers prospered while the rest kept falling through the cracks.

Although dryland agriculture is the mainstay of the Syrian economy, the country has a significant portion of irrigated agriculture that is predominantly drained by the Euphrates, and to a far lesser degree by the Tigris. But with climate change, both waterways were drying up, especially the Khabur, Syria's main tributary to the Euphrates, which saturates the northeastern region of Hasaka. The Khabur has been the iconic source of Syrian agriculture for millennia, whose significance to farming earned it a mention in the Old Testament as ""Habor."" Desiccated, the Khabur couldn't now reach the Euphrates, a failure that had long sown suspicions in downstream Iraq, which is the largest beneficiary of Euphrates water.

Hit by another drought in the mid-1970s, the Euphrates saw its flow of 15.3 billion cubic meters (BCM) to Iraq in 1973 drop drastically to 9.4 BCM in 1975. Iraq accused Syria of diverting its share of water. Syria blamed Turkey, which is home to the headwaters of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Khabur, for the reduced flow. Unconvinced, Iraq deployed tens of thousands of troops to the Iraq-Syrian border in 1975. Damascus answered in kind. A shooting war between upstream and downstream neighbors nearly erupted before the former Soviet Union disengaged the two thirsty foes.

The drought in 2006-11 triggered a mass migration from the rural hinterlands to urban centers. An estimated 1.5 million rural residents were displaced to the fringes of urban centers. Displaced Syrians were all ""climate refugees"" who were without jobs, income, and, above all, any hope to begin a new life. The concentration of despair was highly combustible, and it could easily turn into a conflagration. The spark that ignited this highly flammable situation was the influx of even more drought-driven refugees from neighboring Iraq, bringing urban centers and their scarce services under unprecedented strain.

The influx of Iraqi refugees peaked in 2007 at 1.5 million, bringing the total along with internally displaced Syrians to 3 million. By 2010, these climate refugees amounted to one-fifth of the Syrian urban population. In 2002-2010, Syria added 50 percent moreto its urban population of $22 million. The drought-driven ecological instability shook the Assad regime to its foundation in 2011, when the urban uprising erupted, and for the first time Assad's grip on power began to slip.

The first major protest occurred in the ""impoverished drought-stricken rural province of Daraa"" in March 2011. As protests spread, Homs, Syria's largest city in terms of territory, became the epicenter of political uprising. In July 2012, Syria's most populous city of Aleppo fell to the opposition. In 2013, Raqqa on the Euphrates, which sits next to the country's largest dam (Tabqa Dam) and the biggest reservoir (Lake Assad), was occupied by the Syrian opposition. In January 2014, Raqqa was seized by the Islamic State to become the capital of its caliphate.

The Assad regime, completely resourceless and under a ruthless sanctions regime, had few means to help desperate Syrians struggling to survive. Although poor in ecological and economic resources to cope with a natural disaster, Assad still had a monopoly over violence, the defining feature of a Weberian state. Unable to provide any relief to millions of his masses, Assad simply deployed violence to keep a lid on mass eruptions. By 2016, he regained control of major cities including Aleppo. By 2020, the civil war had ended.

But Assad's repressive measures, including the alleged use of chemical weapons against his own people, elicited a global response that left him and his regime further weakened and those arrayed against him even more emboldened. Soon he was losing the one resource that he thought he controlled: the monopoly over violence. His opposition, meanwhile, was receiving support from the United States, Turkey (a NATO member with the largest military in Europe), Israel and the United Arab Emirates.

Unbeknownst to him, Assad's sclerotic regime was fast hollowing out. Four years after regaining control over much of Syria, the Assad regime fell in just 10 days, when a coalition of the opposition in Hayat Tahrir-al-Shaam (HTS) overran it. The opposition's blitzkrieg began with the fall of the drought-stricken city of Aleppo in the north on November 29. Buoyed by the biggest prize, HTS troops advanced to Hama. The next were Daraa, the cradle of the anti-Assad revolution, and Homs, the crown jewel of Syria's irrigated farming, which were captured on December 7. Aleppo, Hama, Daraa, and Homs had all been at some point agriculturally well-endowed regions.

On December 7, HTS troops reached the peripheries of their ultimate prize, Damascus, the capital. Many of HTS troops defied their command and entered the city, overtaking the main buildings. The next day, the Syrian military practically dissolved itself and Russia whisked Assad away to Moscow. HTS advanced from the north to the south all the way to Damascus and Deir ez-Zor in the east.

Can the incoming rulers save Syria from future drought disasters? Fifty-five percent of Syria is desert that burns with aridity. Due to ever-soaring temperatures, two-thirds of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Khabur have evaporated, leaving behind little for irrigated farming. The incoming rulers, whose credentials are anchored in lifelong careers fueling an insurgency, can hardly match the looming existential threats in climate change or its manifestations in

Hollywood Labor Leaders Share AI Negotiation Strategy for Easing Member Concerns about Job Insecurity and Emphasize Unity,"It didn't take long into a key Labor Innovation & Technology Summit panel before the prevailing sentiment among Hollywood workers was given voice.

""The fear of replacement is very real at this moment and in this room,"" said Linda Powell, EVP of SAG-AFTRA and moderator of the session, titled ""Negotiating AI Contracts: How Unions Can Advance All Protections Across Sectors.""

Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator, noted the positioning of the LIT Summit during CES, the major tech confab where a range of AI wares are on display. ""CES has helped us identify trends coming down the road and separate the wheat from the chaff"" in terms of focusing resources and energy, he said. NFTs, he noted, ""were the last thing everyone was freaking out about"" but labor leaders were able to see it lose steam among the technorati.

""Complete transparency"" is crucial when negotiating AI contracts, Crabtree-Ireland emphasized. Case in point, when contracts are hammered out, even with smaller players, the final version is published online, a lesson he learned when SAG-AFTRA failed to do so last year.

On a more conceptual level, Crabtree-Ireland said, ""we don't have the choice of stopping the technology from happening."" He continued, ""If we're going to make the most of the leverage of power that we have at unions, we can't just be against the technology. Because that didn't work with the invention of electricity, or the internet, or the VCR.""

In 2023, both actors and writers made AI protections a key objective in their bargaining, fueled by the introduction of OpenAI's updated version of ChatGPT, which kicked off debate across society and in business about its impact. The overriding concern in the already-battered entertainment business is that IP could be used to train AI, diluting the value of creative work and compromising the privacy and identity of individual members of the creative community. While a large portion of the panel centered on takeaways from the 2023 talks, the session also assessed the stances being assumed ahead of the next round, which will arrive in a little more than a year.

Sam Wheeler, Writers Guild of America East Executive Director, offered a ""disclaimer"" that he started at the WGA in April 2024, months after its watershed contract resolution. He also confessed to having gotten ""egg on my face"" in his prior position with a large ballet union, minimizing the threat to members, only to see the unsettling results when one of the members fed images and video of dancers into an AI-driven application. That experience reminded him of the importance of continually reading the room and understanding members' perspectives. ""We can't negotiate contracts on autopilot,"" he said.

Russell Hollander, DGA Executive Director said many members see upside in AI technology, citing Jon Favreau and Robert Zemeckis as two examples. Even so, he said, negotiations seek to cover AI skeptics or even outright opponents in the ranks. Consultation rights, a common provision in collective bargaining agreements designed to protect directors, are sometimes thought of as a minor element in the overall scheme of things, but contractually guaranteed consultation in terms of how AI is used is a useful protection, he said.

Crabtree-Ireland drew applause from the crowd by expressing disdain for the urging of studios and streamers to ""just trust us"" when it comes to responsible use of AI. After saying that to unions, he said, they push for provisions on AI to be removed. ""If you say we should trust you, why don't you want to put that in writing?"" he asked. One of the takeaways from 2023, he added, was how well it worked to ""call them out publicly"" when studios and streamers made missteps with AI.

Powell raised the topic of solidarity, which was a major theme during the 2023 strikes as well as the leadup to them. ""If we can determine that there are common priorities, signaling that far in advance of negotiations with the employers helps whatever union is up first to achieve that because they know it's important to the other unions,"" Hollander said. ""Solidarity doesn't begin when negotiations fail. Solidarity is something you have to work on every single day.""

Crabtree-Ireland said things have been progressing well on the solidarity front. ""Since the start of the pandemic, we have been on a trajectory in the entertainment industry that begins to have deeper and stronger solidarity than we ever have before. And that's not to say that it's perfect, and it's not to say that mistakes don't get made. ... But the type of communication and collaboration that we have has served our members well.""

The DGA, he noted, had reached a deal before SAG-AFTRA and WGA did. Even so, ""they were out on the picket lines with us. Russ was personally out there multiple times.""",2025-01-10,it didnt take long into a key labor innovation technology summit panel before the prevailing sentiment among hollywood workers was given voice the fear of replacement is very real at this moment and in this room said linda powell evp of sagaftra and moderator of the session titled negotiating ai contracts how unions can advance all protections across sectors duncan crabtreeireland sagaftras national executive director chief negotiator noted the positioning of the lit summit during ces the major tech confab where a range of ai wares are on display ces has helped us identify trends coming down the road and separate the wheat from the chaff in terms of focusing resources and energy he said nfts he noted were the last thing everyone was freaking out about but labor leaders were able to see it lose steam among the technorati complete transparency is crucial when negotiating ai contracts crabtreeireland emphasized case in point when contracts are hammered out even with smaller players the final version is published online a lesson he learned when sagaftra failed to do so last year on a more conceptual level crabtreeireland said we dont have the choice of stopping the technology from happening he continued if were going to make the most of the leverage of power that we have at unions we cant just be against the technology because that didnt work with the invention of electricity or the internet or the vcr in 2023 both actors and writers made ai protections a key objective in their bargaining fueled by the introduction of openais updated version of chatgpt which kicked off debate across society and in business about its impact the overriding concern in the alreadybattered entertainment business is that ip could be used to train ai diluting the value of creative work and compromising the privacy and identity of individual members of the creative community while a large portion of the panel centered on takeaways from the 2023 talks the session also assessed the stances being assumed ahead of the next round which will arrive in a little more than a year sam wheeler writers guild of america east executive director offered a disclaimer that he started at the wga in april 2024 months after its watershed contract resolution he also confessed to having gotten egg on my face in his prior position with a large ballet union minimizing the threat to members only to see the unsettling results when one of the members fed images and video of dancers into an aidriven application that experience reminded him of the importance of continually reading the room and understanding members perspectives we cant negotiate contracts on autopilot he said russell hollander dga executive director said many members see upside in ai technology citing jon favreau and robert zemeckis as two examples even so he said negotiations seek to cover ai skeptics or even outright opponents in the ranks consultation rights a common provision in collective bargaining agreements designed to protect directors are sometimes thought of as a minor element in the overall scheme of things but contractually guaranteed consultation in terms of how ai is used is a useful protection he said crabtreeireland drew applause from the crowd by expressing disdain for the urging of studios and streamers to just trust us when it comes to responsible use of ai after saying that to unions he said they push for provisions on ai to be removed if you say we should trust you why dont you want to put that in writing he asked one of the takeaways from 2023 he added was how well it worked to call them out publicly when studios and streamers made missteps with ai powell raised the topic of solidarity which was a major theme during the 2023 strikes as well as the leadup to them if we can determine that there are common priorities signaling that far in advance of negotiations with the employers helps whatever union is up first to achieve that because they know its important to the other unions hollander said solidarity doesnt begin when negotiations fail solidarity is something you have to work on every single day crabtreeireland said things have been progressing well on the solidarity front since the start of the pandemic we have been on a trajectory in the entertainment industry that begins to have deeper and stronger solidarity than we ever have before and thats not to say that its perfect and its not to say that mistakes dont get made but the type of communication and collaboration that we have has served our members well the dga he noted had reached a deal before sagaftra and wga did even so they were out on the picket lines with us russ was personally out there multiple times,climate,0
Awaiting Investors To Unlock Food Potential - New Telegraph,"Investors targeting investments in the country's agric sector have a lot to benefit as food production dominates Federal Government's agenda, Taiwo Hassan writes

Government's policies are geared towards boosting the economy in all ramifications.

For the country's agric sector, most of the policies rolled out so far have failed to impact on Nigerians in terms of food production and security.

Budget

Indeed, the Federal Government announced that it had allocated N132 billion to support farmers and farming activities in 2025, as part of the National Agricultural Development Fund (NADF).

This initiative aims to tackle challenges such as poverty, low productivity, and limited access to resources, which have long hindered agricultural growth in Nigeria.

The NADF, established in 2022, serves as a critical vehicle for financial support and policy implementation. It outlines nine functions, including supporting agricultural development in all aspects, financing the implementation of agricultural policies, strengthening institutions, and providing on-lending opportunities to farmers and corporate bodies.

With this allocation, the Fund aims to empower farmers by ensuring access to critical resources, such as improved seeds, fertilizers, irrigation systems, and market opportunities.

Smallholder farmers, who represent over 80 per cent of Nigeria's agricultural workforce, will be looking out to benefit greatly from this initiative.

Obviously, N132 billion for agric sector in 2025 is nothing to write home about while evaluating the farmers' database as agric experts have expressed their pessimism about the fund being diverted.

In 2024, Nigeria's agric sector recorded steady growth, contributing at its peak of 28.65 per cent to the nation's GDP, driven by increased production in crops such as maize, rice, and cassava, as well as sustained investment in mechanisation and technology adoption.

However, growth was constrained by insecurity in key farming regions, high input costs, and limited access to credit for smallholder farmers.

Inflationary pressures also impacted on the affordability of essential inputs, while climate variability affected yields.

Strengthening climate resilience and ensuring access to affordable financing will be crucial to unlocking the sector's full potential and ensuring its pivotal role in Nigeria's economic diversification agenda.

Rising inflation

There is no doubt that all eyes will be on President Tinubu's government to reduce the all-time high inflation, including food inflation, which has accounted for a spike in food prices nationwide.

During his New Year's message to Nigerians on January 1, Tinubu announced the creation of a National Credit Guarantee Company to help lower the prices of food and essential drugs in Nigeria, saying: ""In 2025, our government is committed to intensifying efforts to lower these costs by boosting food production and promoting local manufacturing of essential drugs and other medical supplies.

""We are resolute in our ambition to reduce inflation from its current high of 34.6 per cent to 15 per cent. ""With diligent work and God's help, we will achieve this goal and provide relief to all our people.""

For instance, as a result of petrol prices surging from N198 to an astonishing N1,030 in just 18 months, inflation has increased from 22.79 per cent in June 2023 to 34.60 per cent in November 2024.

Because fuel is integral to every facet of life, subsidy removal has been a major driver of high food prices, transportation, energy costs, and, generally, the cost of living.

Available data from the NBS showed that food inflation at 39.93 per cent in November 2024 was significantly higher than 24.82 per cent before the subsidy removal. Also, core inflation increased to 28.75 per cent in November 2024 from 19.83 per cent in May 2023.

Agenda

As President Tinubu is determined to tackle the soaring prices of food items, there is no doubt that agric investors will be waiting for multi-stakeholder engagement with various farmers' associations and operators in the value chain.

Specifically, targeted investors will be painstakingly evaluating the impacts of the unveiled 2024 agenda for the sector, which goals were to boost food security, improved employment, ensure economic growth, and eradicate poverty.

According to the the Minister of State for Agriculture, Aliyu Abdullahi, the Ministry is closely aligned with President Tinubu's agenda, which prioritises food security.

He stated that the Ministry had developed a comprehensive 2024 plan to improve the entire agricultural system, with a strong focus on achieving food security.

However, all these goals will be under scrutiny from stakeholders to see whether they would drive production and processing, thereby reducing post-harvest losses, a major problem for farmers in the sector.

In addition to that, they will also be looking at the Ministry's intentions to streamline existing programmes in areas like value chain development, seed production, processing, livestock, and input provision.

Investors will be keenly looking forward to agric dividends this new year as promised by the government

watching out for government's effort to prioritise wheat production and other crops as another measure to combat food scarcity.

Already, stakeholders in the sector have expressed their disappointments that Nigeria, despite its internal capacity, currently only produces half a million metric tons of wheat, while consuming over six million tonnes annually.

They emphasised the need to empower wheat farmers in the 15 wheat-producing states, which include all northern states except Nasarawa, as well as Benue, Kwara, and Kogi.

Beyond wheat, they listed other crops such as rice, maize, cassava, millet, sorghum, and soybean, with ongoing efforts already focused on cassava cultivation.

On this, Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Security explained: ""We're trying to maximise available opportunities like dry season farming, areas where there are no terrorists, areas with adequate farm land and available farmers that we can support to go into irrigation farming.

""We've already kicked start wheat in February last year, right now, preparations are in top gear for maize, rice and cassava.

""Various state governments would come on board because they're stakeholders, so we engage them and in the process they provide us farmers and land.""

Agric extension services

Another major area this year for stakeholders and investors will be the administration of extension services in the sector.

Already, the Minister of Agriculture and Food Security, Senator Abubakar Kyari, had revealed the Ministry's plan to bring in ICT enabled extension services, support soil tests for farmers and also address the issue of political farmers as measures are being put in place to target and support the actual farmers who are truly tilling the land.

So stakeholders will be closely monitoring how government is helping the farmers in shaping agric business, especially farmers that have hectares of land.

According to Kyari, ""what we want to do is to make sure that if we say we are going to plant 100,000 hectares, let's be sure that we know where the 100,000 hectares are.""

Post-harvest losses

One key aspect that stakeholders will be happy to see major improvement is the area of post-harvest losses. Inherent post-harvest losses have been a cause for concern for the government and key stakeholders.

Indeed, government has been making frantic efforts to reduce post-harvest losses by putting in place stringent mea - sures to reduce the losses to the barest minimum.

While speaking on the country's postharvest losses, the Minister of Agriculture and Food Security said: ""We are looking at how we're going to increase the aspect of valorisation of value addition to process some of these commodity because the moment you are able to process some of these commodities properly, it means you'll be reducing their spoilage and bringing more, processed products which farmers can earn income from.

Food scarcity

Already, Nigeria is facing one of the most challenging times in its agricultural sector, being triggered by food insecurity. This may not be unconnected with the mitigating factors affecting the country in general.

The country's food insecurity will be one of the main focus in 2025 as Nigeria plans to aggregate food production. For instance, President Tinubu talked about the security challenges and its multifaceted effects on food security.

He said: ""On the security front, I am happy to announce to you, my compatriots, that our administration is winning the war on terror and banditry.

""Our target is to eliminate all the threats of Boko Haram, banditry, kidnapping for ransom, and the scourge of all forms of violent extremism.

The average cost of basic food items in Nigeria may reach an unprecedented level of price surge in the coming months, exacerbating the already challenging economic conditions.

This projection is based on the decision by farmers in the northern part of the country to export their bumper harvest to neighbouring countries in exchange for foreign currency while neglecting local demand as the dry season approaches.

Biotechnology

Genetic Modified Organism (GMO) is expected to make an impactful change to the country's agriculture this year.

Already, the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) has disclosed that the introduction of biotechnology in the agric sector, will ultimately reduce the country's food imports bills profiles spending on foods importation and improved food security in the country.

This is expected to be very crucial as the country is currently being confronted with $10 billion worth of food stuff annually imported from abroad to meet food and agricultural product needs.

Livestock ministry

However, with the creation of the Livestock Development Ministry out of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security last year, many stakeholders will be paying more attention to the transformation being expected to boom in this new ministry.

Precisely, the new livestock sector provided the ideal opportunity for targeted investors willing to go into full scale agriculture to invest in this year, as all eyes will be on the goodies the new livestock industry has in plans for people to explore and venture into.

Last line

In conclusion, investors will be keenly looking forward to agric dividends this new year as promised by the government as many Nigerians look forward to food availability.",2025-01-10,investors

the economy in all ramifications for the countrys agric sector most of the policies rolled out so far have failed to impact on nigerians in terms of food production and security budget indeed the federal government announced that it had allocated n132 billion to support farmers and farming activities in 2025 as part of the national agricultural development fund nadf this initiative aims to tackle challenges such as poverty low productivity and limited access to resources which have long hindered agricultural growth in nigeria the nadf established in 2022 serves as a critical vehicle for financial support and policy implementation it outlines nine functions including supporting agricultural development in all aspects financing the implementation of agricultural policies strengthening institutions and providing onlending opportunities to farmers and corporate bodies with this allocation the fund aims to empower farmers by ensuring access to critical resources such as improved seeds fertilizers irrigation systems and market opportunities smallholder farmers who represent over 80 per cent of nigerias agricultural workforce will be looking out to benefit greatly from this initiative obviously n132 billion for agric sector in 2025 is nothing to write home about while evaluating the farmers database as agric experts have expressed their pessimism about the fund being diverted in 2024 nigerias agric sector recorded steady growth contributing at its peak of 2865 per cent to the nations gdp driven by increased production in crops such as maize rice and cassava as

"Hollywood Labor Leaders At CES Discuss How Their AI Negotiating Strategy Will Ease Members' ""Fear Of Replacement"" And The Importance Of Sticking Together","Disney Expands ""Magic Words"" Ad Feature To Live Programming, Touts Other Tech Advancements At CES Showcase

It didn't take long into a key Labor Innovation & Technology Summit panel before the prevailing sentiment among Hollywood workers was given voice.

""The fear of replacement is very real at this moment and in this room,"" said Linda Powell, EVP of SAG-AFTRA and moderator of the session, titled ""Negotiating AI Contracts: How Unions Can Advance All Protections Across Sectors.""

Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator, noted the positioning of the LIT Summit during CES, the major tech confab where a range of AI wares are on display. ""CES has helped us identify trends coming down the road and separate the wheat from the chaff"" in terms of focusing resources and energy, he said. NFTs, he noted, ""were the last thing everyone was freaking out about"" but labor leaders were able to see it lose steam among the technorati.

""Complete transparency"" is crucial when negotiating AI contracts, Crabtree-Ireland emphasized. Case in point, when contracts are hammered out, even with smaller players, the final version is published online, a lesson he learned when SAG-AFTRA failed to do so last year.

On a more conceptual level, Crabtree-Ireland said, ""we don't have the choice of stopping the technology from happening."" He continued, ""If we're going to make the most of the leverage of power that we have at unions, we can't just be against the technology. Because that didn't work with the invention of electricity, or the internet, or the VCR.""

In 2023, both actors and writers made AI protections a key objective in their bargaining, fueled by the introduction of OpenAI's updated version of ChatGPT, which kicked off debate across society and in business about its impact. The overriding concern in the already-battered entertainment business is that IP could be used to train AI, diluting the value of creative work and compromising the privacy and identity of individual members of the creative community. While a large portion of the panel centered on takeaways from the 2023 talks, the session also assessed the stances being assumed ahead of the next round, which will arrive in a little more than a year.

Sam Wheeler, Writers Guild of America East Executive Director, offered a ""disclaimer"" that he started at the WGA in April 2024, months after its watershed contract resolution. He also confessed to having gotten ""egg on my face"" in his prior position with a large ballet union, minimizing the threat to members, only to see the unsettling results when one of the members fed images and video of dancers into an AI-driven application. That experience reminded him of the importance of continually reading the room and understanding members' perspectives. ""We can't negotiate contracts on autopilot,"" he said.

Russell Hollander, DGA Executive Director said many members see upside in AI technology, citing Jon Favreau and Robert Zemeckis as two examples. Even so, he said, negotiations seek to cover AI skeptics or even outright opponents in the ranks. Consultation rights, a common provision in collective bargaining agreements designed to protect directors, are sometimes thought of as a minor element in the overall scheme of things, but contractually guaranteed consultation in terms of how AI is used is a useful protection, he said.

Crabtree-Ireland drew applause from the crowd by expressing disdain for the urging of studios and streamers to ""just trust us"" when it comes to responsible use of AI. After saying that to unions, he said, they push for provisions on AI to be removed. ""If you say we should trust you, why don't you want to put that in writing?"" he asked. One of the takeaways from 2023, he added, was how well it worked to ""call them out publicly"" when studios and streamers made missteps with AI.

Powell raised the topic of solidarity, which was a major theme during the 2023 strikes as well as the leadup to them. ""If we can determine that there are common priorities, signaling that far in advance of negotiations with the employers helps whatever union is up first to achieve that because they know it's important to the other unions,"" Hollander said. ""Solidarity doesn't begin when negotiations fail. Solidarity is something you have to work on every single day.""

Crabtree-Ireland said things have been progressing well on the solidarity front. ""Since the start of the pandemic, we have been on a trajectory in the entertainment industry that begins to have deeper and stronger solidarity than we ever have before. And that's not to say that it's perfect, and it's not to say that mistakes don't get made. ... But the type of communication and collaboration that we have has served our members well.""

The DGA, he noted, had reached a deal before SAG-AFTRA and WGA did. Even so, ""they were out on the picket lines with us. Russ was personally out there multiple times.""",2025-01-10,disney expands magic words ad feature to live programming touts other tech advancements at ces showcase it didnt take long into a key labor innovation technology summit panel before the prevailing sentiment among hollywood workers was given voice the fear of replacement is very real at this moment and in this room said linda powell evp of sagaftra and moderator of the session titled negotiating ai contracts how unions can advance all protections across sectors duncan crabtreeireland sagaftras national executive director chief negotiator noted the positioning of the lit summit during ces the major tech confab where a range of ai wares are on display ces has helped us identify trends coming down the road and separate the wheat from the chaff in terms of focusing resources and energy he said nfts he noted were the last thing everyone was freaking out about but labor leaders were able to see it lose steam among the technorati complete transparency is crucial when negotiating ai contracts crabtreeireland emphasized case in point when contracts are hammered out even with smaller players the final version is published online a lesson he learned when sagaftra failed to do so last year on a more conceptual level crabtreeireland said we dont have the choice of stopping the technology from happening he continued if were going to make the most of the leverage of power that we have at unions we cant just be against the technology because that didnt work with the invention of electricity or the internet or the vcr in 2023 both actors and writers made ai protections a key objective in their bargaining fueled by the introduction of openais updated version of chatgpt which kicked off debate across society and in business about its impact the overriding concern in the alreadybattered entertainment business is that ip could be used to train ai diluting the value of creative work and compromising the privacy and identity of individual members of the creative community while a large portion of the panel centered on takeaways from the 2023 talks the session also assessed the stances being assumed ahead of the next round which will arrive in a little more than a year sam wheeler writers guild of america east executive director offered a disclaimer that he started at the wga in april 2024 months after its watershed contract resolution he also confessed to having gotten egg on my face in his prior position with a large ballet union minimizing the threat to members only to see the unsettling results when one of the members fed images and video of dancers into an aidriven application that experience reminded him of the importance of continually reading the room and understanding members perspectives we cant negotiate contracts on autopilot he said russell hollander dga executive director said many members see upside in ai technology citing jon favreau and robert zemeckis as two examples even so he said negotiations seek to cover ai skeptics or even outright opponents in the ranks consultation rights a common provision in collective bargaining agreements designed to protect directors are sometimes thought of as a minor element in the overall scheme of things but contractually guaranteed consultation in terms of how ai is used is a useful protection he said crabtreeireland drew applause from the crowd by expressing disdain for the urging of studios and streamers to just trust us when it comes to responsible use of ai after saying that to unions he said they push for provisions on ai to be removed if you say we should trust you why dont you want to put that in writing he asked one of the takeaways from 2023 he added was how well it worked to call them out publicly when studios and streamers made missteps with ai powell raised the topic of solidarity which was a major theme during the 2023 strikes as well as the leadup to them if we can determine that there are common priorities signaling that far in advance of negotiations with the employers helps whatever union is up first to achieve that because they know its important to the other unions hollander said solidarity doesnt begin when negotiations fail solidarity is something you have to work on every single day crabtreeireland said things have been progressing well on the solidarity front since the start of the pandemic we have been on a trajectory in the entertainment industry that begins to have deeper and stronger solidarity than we ever have before and thats not to say that its perfect and its not to say that mistakes dont get made but the type of communication and collaboration that we have has served our members well the dga he noted had reached a deal before sagaftra and wga did even so they were out on the picket lines with us russ was personally out there multiple times,climate,0
Climate Change Threatens Agriculture,"India's rice and wheat yields are projected to decline by 6-10% due to climate change, threatening food security for millions, senior government officials have warned. One major reason for this is that the changes in climate are reducing the frequency and intensity of Western Disturbances, which bring winter rain and snow to northwest India, leading to water shortages for over two billion people dependent on Himalayan rivers. Experts from the India Meteorological Department and Ministry of Earth Sciences have pointed out the growing erratic nature of weather patterns, with extreme events becoming more frequent and harder to predict. Staples for India's 1.4 billion population like wheat and rice make up 14 percent of global food supplies. Climate change could reduce wheat and rice yields by 6-10 percent, posing serious challenges to the nation's food security.

Rice is also a staple in Kashmir, and we import it in large quantities to compensate for the low paddy output in the region. Now climate change is threatening to further reduce the local rice production by depleting the water resources. Jammu and Kashmir boasts approximately 18,000 glaciers, including large ones like Siachen glacier. These glaciers are an invaluable resource, serving as a lifeline for the region, providing water for agriculture. However, with temperatures on the rise due to climate change, these glaciers are melting at an accelerated pace.

One of the most pressing concerns is the shift in the timing of water availability. Historically, the Valley has relied on the gradual release of water from melting glaciers during the crucial months of June and July, coinciding with the agricultural season when water demand is at its peak. However, changing climate patterns have disrupted this cycle, leading to a surplus of water in March, April, and May when it is not required. It has dire implications for the ecosystem and the people who depend on it. The melting glaciers disrupt the traditional water supply cycle, severely affecting agriculture.

In Kashmir, the impact of climate change on agriculture is further exacerbated by the shrinking paddy lands. According to official figures, over the past seven years, Kashmir has lost a staggering 6,000 hectares of paddy land, reducing the total land under paddy cultivation from 1,35,000 hectares to 1,29,000 hectares. Although there has been a significant increase in rice yield. This threatens both food security and the livelihoods of the people. Although the magnitude of this problem is so huge that mere government policies and interventions can't alter the factors that are global in scale. But yes, government interventions can certainly make a redeeming difference and is the need of the hour.",2025-01-10,indias rice and wheat yields are projected to decline by 610 due to climate change threatening food security for millions senior government officials have warned one major reason for this is that the changes in climate are reducing the frequency and intensity of western disturbances which bring winter rain and snow to northwest india leading to water shortages for over two billion people dependent on himalayan rivers experts from the india meteorological department and ministry of earth sciences have pointed out the growing erratic nature of weather patterns with extreme events becoming more frequent and harder to predict staples for indias 14 billion population like wheat and rice make up 14 percent of global food supplies climate change could reduce wheat and rice yields by 610 percent posing serious challenges to the nations food security rice is also a staple in kashmir and we import it in large quantities to compensate for the low paddy output in the region now climate change is threatening to further reduce the local rice production by depleting the water resources jammu and kashmir boasts approximately 18000 glaciers including large ones like siachen glacier these glaciers are an invaluable resource serving as a lifeline for the region providing water for agriculture however with temperatures on the rise due to climate change these glaciers are melting at an accelerated pace one of the most pressing concerns is the shift in the timing of water availability historically the valley has relied on the gradual release of water from melting glaciers during the crucial months of june and july coinciding with the agricultural season when water demand is at its peak however changing climate patterns have disrupted this cycle leading to a surplus of water in march april and may when it is not required it has dire implications for the ecosystem and the people who depend on it the melting glaciers disrupt the traditional water supply cycle severely affecting agriculture in kashmir the impact of climate change on agriculture is further exacerbated by the shrinking paddy lands according to official figures over the past seven years kashmir has lost a staggering 6000 hectares of paddy land reducing the total land under paddy cultivation from 135000 hectares to 129000 hectares although there has been a significant increase in rice yield this threatens both food security and the livelihoods of the people although the magnitude of this problem is so huge that mere government policies and interventions cant alter the factors that are global in scale but yes government interventions can certainly make a redeeming difference and is the need of the hour,climate,0
Global Ag News for Jan 9.2025 - ADM Investor Services,"CME to Launch New Wheat Contract After Record Crop Trading

CME Group is expanding its suite of agriculture markets with a new wheat contract, a move that could help further increase last year's record volumes.

The exchange's hard red spring wheat contract is set to launch early in the second quarter, pending regulatory approval, CME said in a Wednesday release. The new futures and options will compete with Miami International Holdings Inc.'s spring wheat contract -- the market's longtime benchmark previously traded under the Minneapolis Grain Exchange prior to last year's rebranding as MIAX.

CME said it will no longer carry the MIAX wheat contract on its Globex trading platform. MIAX is expected to launch its Onyx trading platform at the end of the second quarter, preventing any interruption in trading.

Crop-trading volumes have been on the rise, with an increasing world population raising demand for food while Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 disrupted grain markets and sent wheat prices to a record.

CME earlier this month said its average daily volume in agricultural markets increased 13% to a record 1.7 million contracts last year.

The new contract for spring wheat -- a high-protein variety used to make flour for bagels, pizza and pasta -- will add to CME's existing portfolio that includes soft red winter and hard red winter contracts, the latter of which CME acquired over a decade ago after integrating the Kansas City Board of Trade.

Brazil: Widespread wet season showers continue in central and northern Brazil, favorable for filling soybeans, but perhaps hampering the very early harvest. The main harvest period does not start for a couple of weeks yet, so the rain is overall favorable. Showers across the south are much more infrequent for the next couple of weeks, which could be a problem for filling soybeans in Mato Grosso do Sul and Parana and pollinating to filling corn in Rio Grande do Sul.

Argentina: Soil moisture is falling in many areas of Argentina and the forecast is only calling for spotty, isolated showers across the south through next week. That should start leading to issues for early-planted corn that is pollinating to filling. It is still early for late-planted corn and soybeans to have major concerns, but issues may start to pop up with temperatures above normal coinciding with the lack of rainfall.

Northern Plains: The region will see several systems and fronts push through over the next couple of weeks, but not enough to have a significant impact on the drought that continues to be a concern this winter. Temperatures will be more above normal than below it through most of next week, but we could see a big burst of cold air moving back into the region next weekend.

Central/Southern Plains: Cold air that has settled in is extremely cold where the snow from the weekend was the heaviest. The cold could cause winter kill on exposed wheat and higher rations for livestock. A system will move through Texas and Oklahoma Thursday and Friday and may clip southeastern Kansas with some moderate snow as well. That could help the soil moisture situation in these areas. It will also be a generally colder pattern through much of next week too. A big storm system is likely to move through late next week or weekend, potentially bringing some heavier precipitation, but also another burst of very cold air.

Midwest: Another snow producing system will move through southern and eastern areas late Friday and Saturday. A clipper will follow behind it for the weekend into early next week with scattered snow as well. Models are insisting on milder temperatures overall after a cold burst this week, though southern areas that have seen snow could take a while to melt and keep temperatures down for a bit. And a short burst of cold could follow behind the clipper early next week. A much bigger burst of cold air is being forecast for next weekend into the following week behind a large system that could mean heavy precipitation as well.

Lower Mississippi: Water levels remain above the low-water mark in most of the Mississippi and Ohio River systems, bolstered by strong storm this past weekend and another coming up on Thursday and Friday. If yet another one of these larger systems moves through later next week, water levels will continue to be high, allowing for easy transportation. Northern areas of the Mississippi Basin is getting drier though, and could use some precipitation.

The player sheet for Jan.8 had funds: net sellers of 500 contracts of SRW wheat, sellers of 4,000 corn, sellers of 500 soybeans, buyers of 1,000 soymeal, and buyers of 2,500 soyoil.

Brazil's biggest soy state Mato Grosso starts harvest

Farmers in Mato Grosso, Brazil's largest soybean-producing state, have begun reaping their crop after planting delays hampered the start of work, farmer group Aprosoja-MT said on Wednesday.

Aprosoja-MT did not provide an estimate on the progress of this year's harvesting, which is in its early stages. By Jan. 12 last year, Mato Grosso had collected 6.46% of the state's soybeans, according to farmer-backed agricultural institute IMEA.

This season, Mato Grosso planted 12.66 million hectares (31.283 million acres) with soybeans, up 1.47% compared to the previous crop, according to IMEA. With yields poised to recover after last year's drought, production should grow 12.78% to 44 million tons, the institute said.

With regular rainfall, the harvest could be a record, said Luiz Pedro Bier, vice president of Aprosoja-MT. But a more accurate projection could not be made at this time, he added.

""It is too early to guarantee that the harvest will truly be a record,"" said Bier. ""Some factors, such as lack of sunlight at the beginning of the cycle, may have affected productivity, and this is the case for the first areas being harvested in the state.""

Excessive rains during the harvest period are also a concern for farmers in central Brazil.

Aprosoja-MT says it lacks definitive data on the impact of rainfall on the harvest, since work in the state is just beginning. Bier added, however, that in some regions the rains may represent ""an obstacle"" to the progress of harvesting. According to Bier, irrigated crops are yielding fewer soybeans than expected.

Brazil soy exports seen down in Jan, record for 2025 - Anec

Brazil's January soybean exports are estimated at 1.71 million tons, down nearly 30% from the same month last year, although a potentially record harvest could boost shipments in 2025 to an unprecedented 110 million tons, grains exporter lobby Anec said on Tuesday.

The volume forecast for January, if confirmed, would be below the 2.4 million tons shipped a year earlier, according to Anec. But it could mean an increase of about 300,000 tons compared to December, when the reduction in supply during the off-season impacted shipments.

Harvesting of Brazil's new soybean is in its early stages and should intensify from February onwards.

China is by far the biggest buyer of Brazilian soy, having imported 74 million tons last year, or 76% of Brazil's total exports. Spain comes in second, having imported 4.1 million tons.

""Regarding exports, our estimate is that there is potential to export up to 110 million tons, which represents a real challenge to be met in terms of logistics,"" Anec stated. Such high shipments would represent an increase of around 13 million tons compared to 2024, and would also surpass the historic mark of 2023, when 101.3 million tons were shipped, according to Anec data.

Brazil is likely to produce around 170 million tons of soybeans this year, the highest ever, according to private consultancies.

Corn exports were forecast at 2.9 million tons for the current month, also below the 3.5 million registered a year earlier. However, as with soybeans, Anec expects an increase in Brazilian corn exports in 2025 compared to 2024, despite strong domestic consumption amid the expansion of plants using ethanol produced from the cereal.

""The surplus volumes will be destined for export, which should have the potential to reach 42 million tons,"" Anec said. This compares with nearly 38 million tons for 2024.

Dry spell puts southern Brazil soy farmers on alert as rains pound central regions

Dry weather is limiting soybean development in Brazil's southernmost state, putting farmers on alert there at the same time as excessive rain is set to disrupt early harvest work in central areas of the country, according to meteorologists.

Expectations for the 2025 soy harvest in Brazil, the world's largest producer and exporter, are sitting above 170 million metric tons. But output in Rio Grande do Sul, where rains have been scarce, is essential for achieving the target, which would be a record, according to some private consultancies.

""Some areas have gone more than 15 to 20 days without significant showers, and soybean development is starting to be somewhat compromised,"" said agrometeorologist Loana Cardoso, from Rio Grande do Sul's agriculture agency Seapi.

The state, which borders drought-stricken and large grain producer Argentina, could harvest more than 20 million tons if the most upbeat forecasts are confirmed.

""We are not yet in the critical periods of the crop... but we are in a state of alert,"" Cardoso said.

Rural Clima agrometeorologist Ludmila Camparotto said the state's northwestern region, one of the most relevant, is not expected to have rains in the next 12 to 15 days.

Alexandre Nascimento, managing partner and meteorologist at Nottus, said regular rains should return after Jan. 20 and be more frequent through February.

There are also concerns about excessive rainfall disrupting the start of the Center-West harvest, said Nascimento and Rural Clima's Camparotto.

In the northeastern region of Rio Grande do Sul, accumulated rainfall over the next ten days will exceed, at best, 20 millimeters, while in the behemoth farm state of Mato Grosso, some areas will receive around 170 millimeters, according to LSEG data.

Nottus' Nascimento confirmed expectations of heavy rainfall in the first half of the year in central Brazil.

""The crops that would already be harvested during this period will probably have problems due to wintering,"" he said

2025/26 India wheat production prospects remain optimistic amid expanded sown area

2025/26 INDIA WHEAT PRODUCTION: 112.7 [106.2-115.4] MILLION TONS, UNCHANGED FROM LAST UPDATE

2025/26 India wheat production is unchanged from our previous estimate of 112.7 million metric tons (mmt) amid an expansion in our sown area estimate in key producing state, Haryana. Over the past week, northern India experienced dry weather conditions but benefited from favorable late-December rainfall. Overall, current soil moisture levels across the key producing northern states are assessed as adequate to favorable. LSEG's latest weather forecast indicates cool and dry weather throughout the next 10-days over northern India. Cool weather should be beneficial to the crop during the vegetative stage. We will periodically update our production estimate as we continue to closely monitor weather patterns along with key indicators such as crop vegetation densities (NDVI) to assess the condition of the crop as the season progresses.

Hot and dry weather prospects slightly lower Argentina soybean production

2024/25 Argentina: 51.3 [49.0-53.6] MILLION TONS, DOWN 1% FROM LAST UPDATE

Lingering dryness across the central/eastern Pampas and hot weather prospects through late January decrease 2024/25 Argentina soybean production by 1% to 51.3 [49.0-53.6] tons, as planting season comes to an end and growing season begins to ramp up. Our current estimate puts planted area at 17.9 million hectares, in line with the Bolsa de Comercio in Rosario's latest outlook, but below the Bolsa de Cereales in Buenos Aires' 18.4 million hectares. In December's WASDE (released on 10 December), USDA placed Argentina soybean production at 52 million tons, up from its previous projection of 51 million tons in November. Bolsa de Cereales in Buenos Aires and Bolsa de Comercio in Rosario currently forecast production at 50.6 and 53-53.5 million tons, respectively.

Over the past two weeks much of Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and northern Buenos Aires (and areas to the northeast) once again received less than 20 mm of precipitation, far below (up to 70 mm) normal. The only major crop region benefited from the recent weather pattern is Córdoba, which saw a near average rain up to 50 mm in total during the same period. Nearly all of the core producing areas in the Pampas are currently showing at least 6-year low soil moisture levels, owing to persistent dry weather since mid-December. Relatively healthy soil moisture conditions maintained up until early December (thanks to intense wetness during early sowing season) have quickly faded away, and the lack of moisture will likely continue to hamper yield potential as there is no end in sight to dryness through the end of the month. This warrants close attention as most first crop soybeans have already entered their early blooming phases thanks to swift planting pace in December, which makes them readily susceptible to low soil moisture risks moving forward.

Soybean planting is nationally 93% complete so far according to the Ministry of Agriculture, ahead of last year's 89% and the 5-year average of 88%. Bolsa de Cereales in Buenos Aires also reported a progress of 92.7%, well ahead of schedule. In Argentina early soy planting typically ends in December, but second crop soybean (otherwise known as double cropped soybeans) planting can occur until January once wheat is harvested. There is currently no delay in wheat harvest, which should support the remaining soy's rapid sowing pace. Long-term weather outlooks remain gloomy as temperatures are now expected to start to rise significantly, which have remained relatively cool so far somewhat offsetting low precipitation impacts. With hot and dry weather conditions lingering through most of January and potentially into early February as well, yield prospects will likely continue to deteriorate, warranting careful attention.

Indonesia suspects virgin palm oil mixed into used cooking oil exports

Indonesia said on Thursday its exports of used cooking oil and palm oil residue in recent years had exceeded production capacity, indicating crude palm oil (CPO) had been mixed in and prompting it to issue regulation curbing shipments this week.

The world's biggest exporter of palm oil on Wednesday issued a ministerial decree clamping down on shipments of used cooking oil and palm oil residue, aimed to avert a potential shortfall of CPO for domestic industries.

Trade ministry data showed exports of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and High Acid Palm Oil Residue (HAPOR) in 2023 and January-October 2024 far exceeded the Indonesian government's estimate of total capacity of around 300,000 metric tons.

POME and HAPOR are palm oil residue products that can be used to make biofuel or fertiliser.

Shipments of both products reached 3.45 million tons in January-October 2024 and 4.87 million tons in 2023. That compares with CPO exports of 2.70 million tons in the first 10 months of 2024 and 3.6 million tons in 2023.

The ministry also said there was a 21% increase in exports of POME and HAPOR between 2019 and 2023, compared with a 20% drop in CPO exports in the same period.

""This justifies (the view) that the exported POME and HAPOR were not purely from residue or used CPO processing, but were also a mixture of virgin CPO,"" trade minister Budi Santoso said in a press statement.

Budi said that without regulations to curb exports availability of CPO for domestic use could be at risk.

Authorities have previously alleged that some cooking oil sold under a government programme called ""Minyakita"" had been mislabelled as used cooking oil and shipped overseas for biodiesel feedstock.

Separately, in June 2024, a group of U.S. senators alleged fraudulent used cooking oil had been shipped from China to the United States, including some cargoes that might include virgin palm oil.

Indonesia Tightens Rules on Exporting Used Cooking Oil, POME

Govt will now hold meetings to decide exports plans for used cooking oil, palm oil mill effluent (POME) and High Acid Palm Residue (HAPOR), according to a new trade ministry regulation posted on website.

China accelerates efforts to boost crop yields, ensure food security

China will accelerate the breeding of new soybean and corn varieties and prioritize yield improvements for key grains and oil crops, as part of broad efforts to ensure food security, the agriculture ministry said in a statement late on Wednesday.

The focus will be on five key crops - corn, rice, wheat, soybeans and rapeseed - and the better use and coordination of good land, high quality seeds, machinery and farming practices, the ministry said.

The ministry aims to increase grain production by 50 million metric tons by 2030, which would be a 7% increase over last year's record grain harvest.

In 2024, China's total grain production reached an all-time high of 706.5 million tons, 1.6% higher than 695.41 million tons in 2023.

The agriculture ministry also called for coordinated funding to support the efforts to boost yields and help reduce China's reliance on imports to ensure food security for its 1.4 billion people.

China still relies on imports of key agricultural products, especially soybeans and corn, to feed its people and livestock.

""We will vigorously promote stable grain production, yield increases, and ensure the secure supply of grain and key agricultural products,"" the ministry said.

USDA Looks to Stockpile Bird Flu Vaccines for Poultry

The US Department of Agriculture is looking to build a national stockpile of vaccines to protect commercial poultry from the bird flu.

It is the most devastating fire in LA county history and could cost up to $57 billion in damages.

Today we will have an early close in grain markets, at 12:15pm CST. The settlement period will be between 11:59am-12:00pm CST with a 15 min post settlement period following. I expect some volatility to seep into the row crop boards due to tomorrow's USDA WASDE, quarterly grain stocks and wheat seedings reports. Argentina could see some relief in the next 10-15 days with rain starting to creep into their forecasts. Brazil continues to receive showers scattered across their main growing areas. I do not expect a large decrease in Argentina production in tomorrow's report. The USDA may increase their Brazilian production estimate above 170 MMT, but Argentina will likely go nearly unchanged until next month's report. Mato Grosso has just started early bean harvest. By January 12th 2024, Mato Grosso had already harvested 6% of their bean crop. Corn could see a drop in production in tomorrow's report.

Murder of young Suleman Masih shocks Christian community in Pakistan - ZENIT - English,"According to information provided to the pontifical foundation Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) by the Pakistani priest, Fr Lazar Aslam OFM, Suleman Masih was a very hardworking and entrepreneurial young man. He began his journey collecting waste materials and with a lot of efforts eventually acquired agricultural machinery to work on wheat and rice fields. Over the past year, he achieved considerable success, managing 25 acres of land and owning a vehicle.

(ZENIT News / Pakistan, 01.09.2024).- The tragic death of Suleman Masih, a 24-year-old Christian, has shocked the local community and once again highlighted the challenges faced by Christians and other religious minorities in Pakistan. Suleman was attacked on December 29, 2024, in Kot Saadullah, Rahawali, Gujranwala, and succumbed to his injuries on New Year's Day.

According to information provided to the pontifical foundation Aid to the Church in Need (ACN) by the Pakistani priest, Fr Lazar Aslam OFM, Suleman Masih was a very hardworking and entrepreneurial young man. He began his journey collecting waste materials and with a lot of efforts eventually acquired agricultural machinery to work on wheat and rice fields. Over the past year, he achieved considerable success, managing 25 acres of land and owning a vehicle.

However, his success made him a target of hostility due to jealousy. For six months, Suleman endured threats, attacks and harassment, including intentional damage to his machinery and the destruction of his crops. Despite reporting these incidents to the authorities, there was little to no action, leaving him vulnerable to further violence, Fr Aslam tells ACN.

On December 29, Suleman was brutally attacked and shot, sustaining severe kidney damage. He died on January 1. Another individual, who was also injured in the incident, initially gave a false statement, under police pressure. However, eyewitness accounts revealed that Suleman was an innocent victim of a deliberate attack.

So far, four of the five attackers have been arrested. However, the main perpetrator remains at large.

This case is a reminder of the challenges Christians and other minorities face in Pakistan and the importance of strengthening justice and equality under the law. Aid to the Church in Need has repeatedly reported and denounced this situation.

Fr Lazar Aslam and Suleman's family call for justice and urge both local and international authorities to take decisive action to protect religious minorities and prevent further acts of violence and social and religious discrimination.

ACN project partner, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (NCJP), visited the victim's family after the incident and participated in the memorial service on January 4. After carrying out a fact-finding mission, the NCJP concluded that the incident was ""a case of religious discrimination"".",2025-01-10,according to information provided to the pontifical foundation aid to the church in need acn by the pakistani priest fr lazar aslam ofm suleman masih was a very hardworking and entrepreneurial young man he began his journey collecting waste materials and with a lot of efforts eventually acquired agricultural machinery to work on wheat and rice fields over the past year he achieved considerable success managing 25 acres of land and owning a vehicle zenit news pakistan 01092024 the tragic death of suleman masih a 24yearold christian has shocked the local community and once again highlighted the challenges faced by christians and other religious minorities in pakistan suleman was attacked on december 29 2024 in kot saadullah rahawali gujranwala and succumbed to his injuries on new years day according to information provided to the pontifical foundation aid to the church in need acn by the pakistani priest fr lazar aslam ofm suleman masih was a very hardworking and entrepreneurial young man he began his journey collecting waste materials and with a lot of efforts eventually acquired agricultural machinery to work on wheat and rice fields over the past year he achieved considerable success managing 25 acres of land and owning a vehicle however his success made him a target of hostility due to jealousy for six months suleman endured threats attacks and harassment including intentional damage to his machinery and the destruction of his crops despite reporting these incidents to the authorities there was little to no action leaving him vulnerable to further violence fr aslam tells acn on december 29 suleman was brutally attacked and shot sustaining severe kidney damage he died on january 1 another individual who was also injured in the incident initially gave a false statement under police pressure however eyewitness accounts revealed that suleman was an innocent victim of a deliberate attack so far four of the five attackers have been arrested however the main perpetrator remains at large this case is a reminder of the challenges christians and other minorities face in pakistan and the importance of strengthening justice and equality under the law aid to the church in need has repeatedly reported and denounced this situation fr lazar aslam and sulemans family call for justice and urge both local and international authorities to take decisive action to protect religious minorities and prevent further acts of violence and social and religious discrimination acn project partner the catholic commission for justice and peace ncjp visited the victims family after the incident and participated in the memorial service on january 4 after carrying out a factfinding mission the ncjp concluded that the incident was a case of religious discrimination,climate,0
Federal gov't spending on climate change soars,"WESTERN PRODUCER -- Agriculture Canada spent $223 million more on science and innovation in the 2023-24 fiscal year than it did in 2020-21.

However, the money wasn't used to hire new scientists, expand research centres or study innovative technologies such as gene edited crops.

The $223 million in extra funding for science and innovation was directed at greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture.

In an email, an Agriculture Canada spokesperson said the Science and Innovation branch spent $829.6 million in 2023-24 on its various activities.

This means 27 percent of last year's budget for Science and Innovation was dedicated to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and making agriculture more resilient. The amount spent on reducing emissions was lower in 2022-23, at around $193 million.

""That represents 24.5 per cent of the spending within Science and Innovation on average over the past two years,"" the spokesperson said.

To put $223 million in context, Agriculture Canada operates 20 research centres in Canada from St. John's, N.L. to Agassiz, B.C.

The annual cost of operating and maintaining those centres is $50 to $55 million, the department says, not including salaries for employees.

Science and Innovation is one of three ""core responsibilities"" for Agriculture Canada. The other two are Domestic and International Markets and Sector Risk.

The role of Science and Innovation is to increase the Canadian agriculture/agri-food knowledge base through research.

As well, it helps the agriculture and agri-food sector transform ""ideas into new products, processes, or practices,"" says the 2024-25 departmental plan.

The document further explains that Science and Innovation contributes to three domains for quality of life in Canada -- prosperity, productivity and the environment.

In the last few years, farmers and farm groups have criticized the government for its fixation on the environment and climate change.

Some Agriculture Canada scientists have also criticized the shift in priorities, saying the federal government got bored with traditional agricultural research, such as plant breeding.

""If money is taken out of field-ready cultivar development, what happens is we start lagging behind the rest of the world and our farmers become less competitive,"" said Robert Graf, a former winter wheat breeder with Agriculture Canada in Lethbridge.

""Part of sustainability is also the ability of farmers to ... make some money. (That) used to be talked about a lot more.""

The extra $223 million for climate change research and initiatives within Agriculture Canada's Science and Innovation branch comes from several federal programs.

In the early 2020s, the government announced $1.57 billion in spending to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture and make farming more sustainable.

Those programs include:

the On Farm Climate Action Fund, which encourages adoption of rotational grazing, use of cover crops and improved nutrient management Living Labs Resilient Ag Landscape Program Agricultural Clean Technology (ACT) Program

""The ACT program aims to create an enabling environment for the development and adoption of clean technology that will help drive the changes required to achieve a low-carbon economy and promote sustainable growth in Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector,"" Agriculture Canada says.

Last May, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada published a report on Agriculture Canada spending on climate change activities.

The report criticized the department, saying it had ""no strategy to meet its expected contributions to reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.""

John Barlow, the Conservative party's agriculture critic, said the auditor general's report shows that the government is getting a poor return on its climate change investments.

""What are you showing for that extra $200 million?"" he said.

""You're just throwing money at something with no clear vision of what that's going to achieve ... without any tangible metrics of what is successful and what's not.""

Barlow pointed to part of the 2023-24 Agriculture Canada budget, indicating the feds are spending less on market development.

The budget for Domestic and International Markets went from $884 million in 2021-22 to a forecasted budget of $811 million in 2023-24.

""They (farmers) really need better access to domestic and international markets, but that part of the budget has gone down,"" Barlow said.

""This is a very ideological government, in every single department. It's showing with agriculture groups throwing up their hands and saying, 'we can't take this, we've had it, this is not where our priorities are.'""

How to Lower Blood Sugar: Simple Carb Swaps for Stable Glucose Levels - News Directory 3,"Managing blood sugar levels is crucial for overall health, and making smart food choices can make a big difference.  Nutritional consultant and holistic health practitioner Dan Jackowiak ⁣emphasizes the ⁤importance of focusing on nutrient-dense foods that have a minimal impact ⁢on blood sugar.

""If you're⁣ looking to lower blood glucose levels, you'll want⁣ to start with reducing the glycemic load⁢ of your meals,"" ⁣Jackowiak advises.

He recommends concentrating on whole, nutrient-rich foods like non-starchy vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and ⁢high-fiber fruits like⁢ berries.These ⁤options ⁢are digested more⁣ slowly, leading to a gradual rise in blood sugar rather⁣ than sharp spikes.

Swap Out Simple Carbs ⁤for Sustained ⁤Energy

Jackowiak cautions against simple carbohydrates like white bread⁢ and sugary drinks, which can cause problematic blood sugar increases.

""Simple carbohydrates will raise blood sugar more than complex carbohydrates such⁤ as⁤ quinoa,sweet ⁤potatoes,fresh vegetables,and whole grains,"" he ⁣explains.

Think of it this way: Complex carbohydrates are like slow-burning fuel for your body, providing sustained ⁢energy and helping to keep blood sugar levels stable.

By making these simple swaps⁤ and prioritizing whole, nutrient-dense foods, you can take control ⁤of your blood sugar and support your overall health.

Maintaining stable blood sugar levels is crucial for overall health and well-being. While ⁣many factors contribute to blood sugar fluctuations, one of the most impactful is our diet.

""Pairing carbohydrates with healthy fats or proteins further stabilizes blood sugar ⁤by ⁢slowing ⁤absorption,"" advises a leading nutritional ⁢consultant.⁣ ""Make sure your meals are balanced.""

This approach helps prevent rapid spikes and crashes in⁣ blood glucose, promoting steadier energy levels throughout the day.

The Power of Balanced Meals

Creating well-rounded meals⁤ that combine different food groups ⁣is key. Think⁤ of your plate as a canvas:

Fill ⁢half your plate ⁣with non-starchy vegetables: Broccoli,spinach,peppers,and cauliflower are⁣ excellent choices. Dedicate⁢ a quarter to lean protein: chicken, fish, beans,⁢ or tofu provide sustained energy.* Reserve the remaining quarter for complex carbohydrates: Opt for whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, or whole-wheat bread.Beyond the Plate: Exercise and Medical⁣ Guidance

While diet plays a vital role, other lifestyle factors also influence ⁣blood sugar control.

Regular exercise, such as brisk ⁢walking, strength training, or yoga, can significantly improve insulin sensitivity, allowing your⁤ body to use glucose more effectively.

""Monitoring your blood sugar levels with a healthcare professional allows you ⁢to track trends and make personalized adjustments to your diet and lifestyle,"" the consultant emphasizes.

Keeping a log of meal times, carbohydrate intake, and blood sugar readings before and after meals can provide valuable insights for managing your blood sugar effectively.

Remember, small changes can make a big difference. By prioritizing balanced meals,incorporating regular exercise,and working closely with your healthcare provider,you ⁢can take control of⁤ your blood⁤ sugar and pave the way⁣ for a healthier,more vibrant life.

Austin Roest Returns To The Everett Silvertips,"Austin Roest is back in the WHL. The Nashville Predators prospect was reassigned to the Everett Silvertips on Thursday, giving the current U.S. Division leaders a massive boost before the 2025 trade deadline. Roest has been dealing with an injury all season, and while he was on the Milwaukee Admirals's roster, he hasn't played a game this year.

The addition of Roest makes an already stacked Silvertips roster even stronger. Last season, he had 71 points in games before recording seven in five playoff games. Roest was also a co-captain in 2023-24 and set a new career-high with 38 goals.

This season, Everett has been one of the most consistent teams in the CHL. Through 38 games, they have a record of 28-5-3-2 and are the only team in the WHL with more than 55 points. The Silvertips also have six players who are over a point per game, including defenceman Landon DuPont, who is up to 41 points in 34 games.

While bringing in Roest is not a trade, it will have a similar impact. He currently sits 11th all-time in franchise scoring and should become the seventh player to score 100 goals for Everett later this season. Roest will also play a major role during the postseason as the Silvertips look for their first WHL Championship in franchise history.

Column-Will USDA data dump spoil the bullish party for corn? -Braun,"NAPERVILLE, Illinois (Reuters) - If anything can derail a price rally, it is a curveball from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Chicago corn futures have ticked slightly lower to start the year, but they had climbed nearly 12% in the final two months of 2024, an unusually strong late-year run.

Speculators now hold their most bullish corn view in two years, and luckily for them, the trade has already accepted that last year's U.S. corn yield was a whopper.

Friday will feature USDA's biggest data release of the year, with primary focus on the most recent U.S. corn and soybean harvests. U.S. quarterly stocks, U.S. winter wheat seedings and routine global supply and demand updates will also compete for attention.

U.S. CORN AND BEANS

On average, analysts peg U.S. corn yield at 182.7 bushels per acre, down from 183.1 in November. The trade estimate is more than 5 bushels above last year's record and above USDA's initial trendline yield for the first time in six years.

Bearish yield outcomes are less likely when the estimates are already large, and only four of 19 polled analysts see corn yield rising from November. However, the range of trade estimates (2.4 bpa) is smaller than usual, flagging the potential for surprise.

In the last decade, analysts anticipated the wrong direction of U.S. corn yield in January only once (2019). They did so three times for soybean yield (2016, 2019, 2022).

But bets are somewhat off for U.S. soybean yield outcomes because USDA's slashing of the forecast in November was the month's largest cut in 31 years. Trade estimates indicate some uncertainty around U.S. soybean production as the ranges for both yield and harvested area are historically wide.

Regardless, U.S. soybean supplies are expected to remain ample and at multi-year highs. However, USDA last month pegged 2024-25 U.S. corn ending stocks below the prior year's level for the first time.

If USDA cuts U.S. corn ending stocks on Friday as expected, it would be the agency's seventh consecutive monthly reduction. Such a streak has not been observed in at least two decades, reflective of the strong demand that has recently lifted corn prices.

From a market reaction standpoint, these demand dynamics could be somewhat insulating if the U.S. corn crop comes in larger than expected. The last two times CBOT corn had a distinctly negative reaction on January report day were 2012 and 2024, the latter sparked by a huge yield above all trade estimates.

U.S. WHEAT

USDA will not officially issue 2025-26 outlooks until May, but the wheat market will receive its first piece of 2025-26 U.S. crop intel on Friday with the winter wheat planting survey. Total U.S. winter wheat acres are pegged at 33.37 million, very close to both last year and the five-year average.

Analysts have had a rough time anticipating the planting survey in the last two years, coming in almost 1.4 million acres too high last year but lowballing by nearly 2.5 million acres in 2023.

Wheat traders have struggled to find viable bullish narratives despite wheat stocks among major exporters seen dropping to 17-year lows, so another big miss in the U.S. wheat acreage could either support or undermine the recent sentiment.

SOUTH AMERICA

The U.S. crops will probably dominate the headlines on Friday, but it is not too early to watch out for forecast changes in South America. Analysts see USDA upping Brazil's 2024-25 soybean harvest to a record 170.28 million metric tons from the previous 169 million.

USDA has increased Brazil's soy crop in three of the last eight Januarys, both on area and yield improvements, and many industry participants have already been factoring in a number north of 170 million tons.

For Argentina, there are already fears that ongoing dry weather could eventually warrant more significant cuts to soybean and corn crops than are anticipated for Friday. American and European weather model runs on Thursday remained stingy with the rainfall over the next two weeks.

Worried homeowner seeks food storage advice in case of an emergency: 'Cheap and easy',"As extreme weather events become more frequent and more intense, it makes sense to have a plan in place for how you will cope if you have to hunker down for a while. This problem was a bit more complex for one prepper with a food allergy, and they turned to the r/preppers subreddit for advice.

""I have a tickborne illness that makes me allergic to meat/dairy. Any good vegetarian food kits??"" the original poster wrote. ""I'm looking to buy a hefty kit or in bulk, but not finding anything great. Any suggestions?? I've got lots of dried beans and chili, but need other options and protein.""

The OP has alpha-gal syndrome, which is a food allergy spread by the bite of the Lone Star tick. It ""makes people allergic to red meat and other products made from mammals,"" according to the Mayo Clinic.

It is worth noting that just as extreme weather events are on the rise due to the overheating of our planet -- largely caused by burning dirty energy sources such as gas and oil -- so too are tick bites. Warmer climates and more standing water from storms combine to allow disease-spreading insects such as mosquitoes and ticks to expand their ranges, meaning that these two issues are more connected than they may initially seem.

Luckily, members of the subreddit had helpful advice for the food-restricted OP.

""Have you looked into Chickpeas as a protein source? Canned chickpeas are cheap and easy to change the flavor of them,"" one commenter suggested.

""What you're probably wanting is something with TVP (textured vegetable protein) in it, assuming you're specifically looking for long term storage,"" wrote another.

""Seitan in my mind is a great meat alternative prepper food, if you're up for making it yourself. There is a specific way to make seitan called the WTF (wash the flour) method that requires only flour and broth. ... There are other versions that use vital wheat gluten and chickpea flour, both of which last for a long time if stored properly,"" a third commenter chimed in.

Why the West needs prairie dogs,"They're among the region's most despised species, but some tribes, researchers and landowners are racing to save them

The prairie dog caught in Trap 69 was angry. And who could blame her? After waking up in her burrow on a mid-September morning, she'd waddled innocently outside for a breakfast of mini marshmallows and carrots, only to find herself stuck in a wire cage and carried across the prairie. Then a pair of human hands had gripped her like a burrito while two more hands put a black rubber tracking collar around her neck.

The situation was worse than she realized: Prairie dogs are among the most maligned and persecuted animal species in the Western U.S. So maligned, in fact, that a 2020 survey in northern Montana found that well over half the area's landowners believed prairie dogs should not live on public land.

To make matters even grimmer, this particular prairie dog had fleas. And those fleas could have been carrying the bacteria that causes plague -- the Black Death. ""It's not great,"" commented researcher Jesse Boulerice as he adjusted his gentle grip around her midsection.

The rodent responded by biting into Boulerice's leather glove, hanging on with her two front teeth while researchers swiped a black streak of Clairol's Nice'n Easy hair dye down her back.

Prairie dogs are among the most maligned and persecuted animal species in the Western U.S.

Though black-tailed prairie dogs have a long-standing reputation as pests, their ingenious tunnel systems and industrious prairie pruning make them one of the West's primary ecosystem engineers. Some researchers call them the ""chicken nuggets of the prairie""; if a prairie species eats meat, it almost certainly eats prairie dogs. Without prairie dogs, black-footed ferrets would never survive outside zoos and breeding facilities, and we would have far fewer mountain plovers, burrowing owls, swift foxes, and ferruginous hawks.

Before 1800, an estimated 5 billion prairie dogs lived from Canada to Mexico, covering the West with underground apartment complexes that shifted over the centuries like sand dunes. The Lakota, Dakota and other Indigenous peoples of the prairie shaped and depended on the ecosystems prairie dogs created. Some relied on prairie dogs for nourishment during thin times, or used them as a ceremonial food.

But European settlers were remarkably effective at shooting and poisoning prairie dogs and plowing up their burrows. Today, the five prairie dog species occupy just 2% of their historic range, and some occupy even less.

Prairie dogs still survive in many of their historic territories: Black-tailed prairie dogs, known for their especially large, dense colonies, persist in isolated pockets of the prairie east of the Rocky Mountains from Canada to Mexico. White-tailed prairie dogs live in parts of Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. Gunnison's prairie dogs eke out an existence in southern Colorado, and Utah prairie dogs live in, well, Utah. Mexican prairie dogs still hang on in small slices of northern Mexico. But many of these populations are too small to serve their ecosystems as they once did.

Within this familiar story of colonization and species decline, however, are more hopeful stories of creativity and adaptation: Researchers are using pedometer-like devices to map prairie dogs' underground tunnels, remote-controlled badgers to understand prairie dog alarm calls and Kitchen-Aid mixers to craft solutions to deadly disease. After decades of restoration work by tribal wildlife managers, prairie dogs, black-footed ferrets, swift foxes and bison are once again roaming the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in north-central Montana, one of the few places in the world where all four species coexist. Some private landowners, meanwhile, are finding ways to tolerate the rodents. Together, these researchers, managers and landowners are striving to conserve the West's remaining prairie dogs and the prairie that depends on them.

ONCE THE COLLARED prairie dog was returned to her Tru Catch wire cage to await release, Boulerice reached into the next trap in line.

Boulerice is part of a Smithsonian Institution team that is collaring and tracking prairie dogs at American Prairie -- formerly the American Prairie Reserve -- in central Montana. Each collar measures the animal's acceleration and angle; by triangulating with locations picked up by sensors posted on poles throughout the colony, researchers can determine where and how far the prairie dogs travel both above and below ground. The Clairol dye patterns provide one more way to tell who's who in a colony of look-alikes.

Though other researchers have studied prairie dogs' aboveground lives, no one really knows what they do underground. Satellite imagery can be used to track Arctic terns over Alaska or grizzly bears deep in the wilderness, but it can't penetrate the Earth. Decades ago, researchers laboriously excavated a white-tailed prairie dog burrow in southern Montana, revealing features like ""sleeping quarters,"" hibernacula, and a ""maternity area"" -- but such work is invasive and yields little data on the animals' movements.

At American Prairie in September, the Smithsonian team was joined by researchers from Swansea University in Wales who had developed the tracking collars Boulerice used. The collars were originally designed to study penguins underwater, an environment similarly resistant to conventional satellite tracking.

Prairie dogs aren't the only occupants of prairie dog burrows. The mazes of tunnels and rooms also provide shelter for black-footed ferrets, swift foxes and untold numbers of insects. Burrowing owls shimmy their puffball bodies into the tunnels, where they raise their chicks on the plentiful bugs. Prairie rattlesnakes, tiger salamanders, horned lizards and badgers use them, too.

And as climate extremes become more common aboveground, these burrows may become even more important.

""By creating tunnels, they're also creating a thermal refuge,"" said Hila Shamon, the director of the Smithsonian's Great Plains Science Program and principal investigator of the colony-mapping project. ""The prairie can be so hot in the summer or brutally, brutally cold in the winter. You don't have any shade or place to hide from the cold ... and conditions in the tunnel systems are consistent.""

Prairie dogs spend much of the day and all night in their burrows, living in family coteries composed of one male, three or four females and the year's young. Their tunnel systems, which can extend across an area larger than a football field, are like bustling apartment complexes where every family has its separate unit. Residents periodically pop out of doors to grab food, gossip about the neighbors and scan for danger.

""In the prairie,"" Shamon said, ""there's a whole world that's happening beneath the ground that we can't see. But it exists, and it's very deep, and it's important.""

Aboveground, the effect of prairie dogs on the landscape is more obvious. ""Prairie dogs create an entirely novel habitat type,"" said Andy Boyce, a Smithsonian research ecologist. ""They graze intensely. They increase the forbs and flowering plants, and they clip woody vegetation. They will eat and nibble on a new woody plant until it tips over and dies.""

""In the prairie, there's a whole world that's happening beneath the ground that we can't see, but it exists, and it's very deep, and it's important.""

The landscape created by prairie dogs may look barren, but the reality is more nuanced. A healthy prairie isn't an uninterrupted sea of grass; it's made up of grass and shrubs, wetlands and wildflowers and even large patches of bare dirt that allow prairie dogs -- and other species -- to spot approaching predators.

Bison like to wallow in the dirt exposed by prairie dogs, and graze on the nutritious grass and plants that resprout after a prairie dog pruning. Mountain plovers and thick-billed longspurs frequently nest on the grazed surface of prairie dog towns. (Both birds have declined along with prairie dogs; the mountain plover has been proposed for protection under the Endangered Species Act.)

Prairie dog colonies may also provide other species with a home-alarm system. ""You have 1,000 little pairs of eyeballs constantly searching for predators all around you and then vocalizing loudly when they see them,"" Boyce said. To test this hypothesis, Boyce's Ph.D. student Andrew Dreelin attached a taxidermied badger to a remote-controlled car and drove it near long-billed curlew nests in Montana prairie dog colonies. He then measured how nesting curlews responded to the badger with and without a warning from the prairie dogs.

Results are pending, said Dreelin, but he's certain that ""we've only just started to scratch the surface on the multifaceted ways that prairie dogs could shape the lives of birds on the prairie.""

IN EARLY OCTOBER, about 500 miles south of American Prairie, Colten Salyer also donned thick leather gloves to protect himself from an angry mammal's teeth. Then he opened a cat carrier filled with paper shavings and a member of a species once considered extinct.

The young black-footed ferret inside bared its long white canines. Bred at the National Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center in northern Colorado, she was one of 20 about to be reintroduced to southcentral Wyoming's Shirley Basin.

The black-footed ferret is North America's only native ferret and one of only three ferret species in the world. And if there's one thing black-footed ferrets need, it's prairie dogs. They eat them almost exclusively, and they use their tunnels to live, hunt and reproduce, slipping in and out of burrows as they move like water across the landscape.

In 1980, black-footed ferrets were declared extinct, most likely extinguished by disease, development and endless prairie dog poisoning campaigns. But in 1981, a northern Wyoming ranch dog proudly presented his owners with his most recent treasure: a dead ferret. A local taxidermist confirmed that it was, in fact, a black-footed ferret, a member of a tiny remnant population.

The newly discovered ferrets lived in the wild until 1985, when biologists discovered that disease had killed all but 18. At that point, they scooped up the remaining ferrets and took them to captive breeding facilities. Only seven successfully reproduced, but those seven now have more than 11,000 descendants. In 2020, researchers used DNA from a wild-caught ferret with no surviving offspring to produce the first cloned ferret. Since then, they have created two more cloned individuals, and this past November, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that one had given birth to healthy kits.

Captive-bred ferrets have now been released across the West. But to survive long-term, they need prairie dog colonies. And prairie dogs aren't popular with their human neighbors.

Because they eat the same grass cows do. And they make holes.

""I was running to rope a yearling once, and I stood up in the saddle and was about to open my hand -- and all of a sudden the horse's front end disappeared,"" said Salyer, a ranch manager in Shirley Basin who volunteered to help with the releases. His horse had sunk a hoof into a prairie dog hole, a misstep that sent Salyer tumbling to the ground.

Both Salyer and his horse were fine, and he shrugged after telling the story.But most ranchers have, or have heard, similar stories, many of which end with a valued horse breaking a leg. There's no way to know how frequently horses injure themselves in burrows, but the stories spread as fast as a prairie fire.

What's certain is that prairie dogs eat grass. Quite a bit of grass: A single prairie dog can devour up to 2 pounds of green grass and non-woody plants every week, according to Montana State University. For ranchers who use that vegetation to feed their cows, prairie dogs look like competition. Researchers, however, say the effects of prairie dogs on livestock forage are mixed. Black-tailed prairie dogs' propensity to clip and mow, for instance, results in plants with higher fat and protein and lower fiber. ""Across years, enhanced forage quality may help to offset reductions in forage quantity for agricultural producers,"" a study published in 2019 by Rangeland Ecology and Management reported.

This uncertainty has led to some bureaucratic contradictions. The Wyoming Department of Agriculture labels prairie dogs as pest species and offers training in properly using pesticides to kill them; at the same time, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department lists the black-tailed prairie dog as a species of greatest conservation need.

Until the 1990s, said Randy Matchett, a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist in central Montana, prairie dogs were so despised in places like Phillips County, Montana, that the Bureau of Land Management produced maps of their colonies designed for sport shooters. Attitudes haven't changed much: In 2020, 27 years after an initial survey of attitudes toward black-tailed prairie dogs and black-footed ferrets in Montana, researchers found that feelings about them had barely budged.

Matchett said that when he tells his Montana neighbors that only 2% of prairie dogs remain, a common attitude is: ""What the hell's the holdup getting rid of that last 2%?""

Chamois Andersen, a Defenders of Wildlife senior field representative, has spent decades working with landowners in prairie dog-rich places, and she's persuaded some to allow researchers to survey their land for black-footed ferrets in exchange for funds for noxious weed removal. She speculates that younger generations of ranchers are more open to prairie dog conservation and to partnerships with public agencies and wildlife groups.

Matchett is less optimistic. Even the U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service, which together manage one of the largest black-footed ferret colonies in the world in South Dakota's Conata Basin, poison some prairie dogs on federal land to prevent the population from moving onto private property.

Not all prairie dogs are equally reviled. White-tailed prairie dogs like those in Shirley Basin live at lower densities and tend to clip plants farther up the stems, making them less obvious to the casual observer. Landowners, as a result, are often more tolerant of them than their black-tailed cousins, said Andrew Gygli, a small-carnivore biologist for Wyoming Game and Fish.

Bob Heward, whose family started ranching in Shirley Basin more than a century ago, understands that a disliked species can also be useful.

He invites recreational shooters to target prairie dogs on his land, but he won't use poison to kill the rodents because he knows they provide food for other species. Prairie dogs are a ""nuisance,"" he said, but they're also as inevitable as the wind: ""We've learned to live with them. They've been here longer than I have.""

Randy Matchett said that when he tells his Montana neighbors that only 2% of prairie dogs remain, a common attitude is: ""What the hell's the holdup getting rid of that last 2%?""

THE MALE SWIFT FOX at the end of the trap line was chunky, at least by swift fox standards: Though he weighed only about 5 pounds, his belly was round beneath his fluffy fur. His black eyes carefully followed Smithsonian researcher Hila Shamon as she loaded him into the backseat of her four-door pickup, covering the trap with a blanket as she prepared to transport him from this ranch north of Laramie, Wyoming, to a new home on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana.

Unlike black-footed ferrets, swift foxes can survive without prairie dogs, but when prairie dogs are scarce they suffer from the loss of food, Shamon said, and are deprived of the shelter they find in prairie dog burrows. So they, too, declined as prairie dogs were exterminated and prairie habitat was converted into cropland. By the early 1900s, they had disappeared from Canada, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma.

But swift foxes still live in parts of the West -- and in some places, their populations are being restored. For the last five years, Shamon and her team have trapped swift foxes in Wyoming and Colorado and trucked them to Fort Belknap. This rectangle of grassland, buttes and prairie breaks near the Canadian border is home to the Nakoda (Assiniboine) and A'aninin (Gros Ventre), both Great Plains peoples. Today, it is one of the only places in the world where prairie dogs, swift foxes, black-footed ferrets and bison co-exist.

Montana State Sen. Mike Fox (Gros Ventre), D, who served as Fort Belknap's director of Fish and Wildlife from 1991 to 2001, oversaw early efforts to restore buffalo, swift foxes and black-footed ferrets to the reservation. The goal was to ""create a steady, healthy population of native animals that were driven to extinction because of the different uses of the land,"" he said. ""Like when they started poisoning the prairie dogs off in the '30s and '40s and wiped out the ferrets that were native here, and the same with the swift fox. We want to make as complete an ecosystem as we can, along with the buffalo.""

The tribes worked with the Fish and Wildlife Service to reintroduce black-footed ferrets, and, with researchers at the Smithsonian, World Wildlife Fund and other organizations, to bring back the swift fox. The collaborators spent two years planning the swift fox capture and translocation, Shamon said, considering factors like habitat quality, community attitudes and the overall risk to a re-established population.

Swift foxes had already been reintroduced in parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan and on the Blackfeet and Fort Peck reservations. The reintroduction at Fort Belknap continued the tribes' restoration efforts and added a possible point of connectivity for other populations.

Tribal members living on and near the Fort Belknap Reservation have largely supported the reintroduction of native prairie species, especially after prairie dog numbers were diminished by an outbreak of disease in the late '90s, Fox said. Now that the population is recovering and has started to clear larger areas of grass, however, some tribal members who raise cattle have begun expressing frustration to the tribal council.

""Wildlife and cattle will graze prairie dog colonies because of the new growth coming back throughout the year,"" said Fox. ""It makes it look even worse because it's attractive to wildlife and domestic cattle, and they do their part. When it starts looking like a moonscape is when we get people noticing the most.""

He tells people that the little grass-eating rodents are necessary, and notes that the ""moonscapes"" aren't as widespread as they may seem. But like non-Native ranchers across the West, some tribal members equate abundant prairie dogs with fewer cows. Fox doesn't believe the council will allow widespread prairie dog poisoning on tribal lands -- especially since the reservation now hosts black-footed ferrets -- but he does worry that opposition could intensify.

Bronc Speak Thunder (Assiniboine), director of the Fort Belknap Buffalo Program, has also heard people complain about prairie dogs, though he added that ""people complain about a lot of stuff.""

The tribes aren't actively restoring prairie dogs, he said; they're simply refraining from poisoning and shooting them. He sees that prairie dogs benefit tribal land by creating more habitat for ground-nesting birds and serving as food for swift foxes, coyotes, hawks and eagles. They also encourage the growth of nutritious grass for bison. ""Like life, it's a big circle, and that's where it fits,"" he said. ""They're part of the ecosystem that exists, and if you take something out, it throws everything off.""

WHEN I MET Randy Matchett, the Fish and Wildlife Service biologist, he sported a cowboy hat and graying horseshoe mustache and carried a handful of Smurf-blue flea-control pellets, each slightly smaller than a marble. The pellets, which Matchett produced in his workshop at the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge headquarters in Lewistown, Montana, are his latest attempt to protect prairie dogs from a fatal disease.

The pellets contain Fipronil, an insecticide used in treatments likeFrontline to keep fleas and ticks away from household pets, and are flavored with peanut butter and molasses to increase their chances of ending up in prairie dog bellies. Matchett dyes them blue because research shows prairie dogs are attracted to the color, and because the dye stains their feces, making it easy to estimate how many animals have consumed the pellets. Once ingested, Matchett hopes, his ""FipBits"" will kill the fleas that land on and bite prairie dogs, including the fleas carrying the bacteria that causes plague.

Yes, that plague. The bacte-ria Yersinia pestis causes bubonic plague, which became known as the Black Death after it killed at least 25 million Europeans during the 14th century.

In 1900, the disease arrived in North America via San Francisco, carried by rats stowed away on ships. During the following decades, the development of antibiotics controlled the disease in humans, but plague continued to spread among rodent species, affecting black-footed ferrets, rabbits and squirrels. First detected in prairie dogs in 1936, it devastated populations already hit hard by the conversion of the prairie to agriculture -- and it remains a major threat to prairie dogs.

""Once colonies have plague, they can disappear in two weeks,"" said Shamon. ""There will be thousands of acres chirping with thousands or tens of thousands of animals and in two weeks, you will go map it, and they're gone.""

A plague vaccine does exist, and is used to protect highly endangered species like black-footed ferrets. But it's simply not possible to jab every prairie dog in the West. Matchett, who as a Fish and Wildlife biologist is responsible for conserving endangered species, got involved in plague prevention in the early 1990s, initially dusting prairie dog colonies for fleas. In 2013, he began testing oral vaccines in Montana colonies, working in parallel with researchers in seven other states. The first-generation vaccines were red, peanut-butter flavored cubes with a biomarker that tinted prairie dog whiskers pink. Matchett and his colleagues in Colorado also developed vaccine pellets that they mass-produced using a Lithuanian carp bait-making machine. Matchett helped craft a pellet shooter that could be bolted to the front of a four-wheeler.

Prairie dogs are ""part of the ecosystem that exists, and if you take something out, it throws everything off.""

With the new vaccines primed to launch, Matchett felt hopeful. The World Wildlife Fund, which helped fund some of the work, felt hopeful, too. But in 2018, after years of trials with thousands of prairie dogs, he and other researchers concluded that even when a colony was given oral vaccinations, the number of prairie dogs that survived a plague outbreak was too small to support a black-footed ferret population.

So Matchett pivoted. If he couldn't inoculate prairie dogs against plague, maybe he could kill the fleas that carried the bacteria. What if he could persuade prairie dogs to eat Fipronil?

He made a new set of pellets with the same bait machine, this time using his wife's grandmother's Kitchen-Aid mixer to blend various types of flour, vital wheat gluten, peanut butter, molasses and other food-grade ingredients with a soupçon of flea killer. Early results have been promising: While adult fleas aren't affected until they bite a prairie dog that's ingested a pellet, not every flea needs to be killed; studies have shown that in general, fleas don't trigger plague outbreaks until they reach a critical mass. And flea larvae appear to die when they crawl into or consume treated prairie dog poop, suggesting that the pellets could tamp down flea reproduction as well as kill the adult insects.

FipBits aren't the only way to reduce the toll plague takes on prairie dogs, but Matchett believes they're the most likely to work. In his office, perched on stacks of files, are the remnants of another of his many assaults on the problem: dozens of vials of alcohol, each containing bits of prairie dog ears. In 2007 and 2008, Matchett and his colleagues collected the snippets from prairie dogs that had survived plague outbreaks, hoping genetic analysis would explain their fortitude. The material has yet to be analyzed owing to a ""combination of lack of funding, interest, time and capability,"" Matchett said, but he hopes new funding will allow him and his collaborators to return to the project.

Despite the setbacks, Matchett believes researchers can find a way to control plague in prairie dogs. Human intolerance, as he sees it, is a more stubborn problem. Places like Fort Belknap and the Conata Basin of South Dakota -- where prairie dogs are, at least for now, allowed to flourish -- remain few and far between.

DRIVE SOUTH from Fort Belknap down Highway 191, head east on a straight gravel road, and you'll find one more place where prairie dogs are left in peace.

American Prairie began in 2001 as an effort to protect and restore Montana's grasslands. The nonprofit now manages more than 527,000 acres of private land and federal and state leases. Its ultimate goal is to connect 3.2 million acres of prairie, providing habitat for an array of species from bison to mountain plovers to black-footed ferrets. To the casual observer, American Prairie's lands may already look like intact prairie, though ecologists like Daniel Kinka can't help noticing the nonnative crested wheatgrass and the hundreds of miles of fencing.

""This is kind of like the Field of Dreams model: If you build it, they will come,"" said Kinka, American Prairie's director of rewilding. ""A better habitat houses more wildlife, and the wildlife that are here are perfectly capable of restoring themselves.""

American Prairie prohibits the poisoning and shooting of prairie dogs on its land, and it regularly hosts research projects such as the Smithsonian's burrow mapping -- which may help explain how plague spreads within colonies -- and Matchett's tests of plague-mitigation tools. Prairie dogs, said Kinka, are the ""unsung heroes of a prairie ecosystem,"" important to all the other species American Prairie is trying to foster. And as researchers have found, the woody plants that prairie dogs chew down to clear their line of sight tend to be replaced by nutritious grasses and wildflowers, suggesting that even cattle may benefit from their presence.

The possibility that prairie dogs could be good for cattle, or at least not as bad as generally believed, is met with skepticism by American Prairie's neighbors, many of whom see the nonprofit as a threat to ranching. Signs posted along highways in Phillips County, Montana, read ""Save the American Cowboy. Stop American Prairie Reserve."" For now, Kinka isn't trying to convince anyone to like or even appreciate prairie dogs, aiming instead for tolerance.

The black-tailed prairie dog complex studied by the Smithsonian team at American Prairie is a noisy place, filled with the barks and trills of hundreds of creatures. As I stood beside researcher Jesse Boulerice, listening, it was easy to imagine that the rodents were doing just fine. But they're not. Will they ever be allowed to exist in numbers like this throughout their historic range?

Boulerice surveyed the surface of the colony, which was covered with dried plant nubs and bare mounds of dirt, and said he wasn't sure.

Then he released a collared prairie dog who wagged her chubby butt in the air as she scurried into a nearby hole. She promptly popped back up, chirping out a message we'll never understand. Perhaps she was warning her colony-mates to watch out for those marshmallows and carrots; they hide a nasty trap.

persecuted animal species in the western us so maligned in fact that a 2020 survey in northern montana found that well over half the areas landowners believed prairie dogs should not live on public land to make matters even grimmer this particular prairie dog had fleas and those fleas could have been carrying the bacteria that causes plague the black death its not great commented researcher jesse boulerice as he adjusted his gentle grip around her midsection the rodent responded by biting into boulerices leather glove hanging on with her two front teeth while researchers swiped a black streak of clairols nicen easy hair dye down her back prairie dogs are among the most maligned and persecuted animal species in the western us though blacktailed prairie dogs have a longstanding reputation as pests their ingenious tunnel systems and industrious prairie pruning make them one of the wests primary ecosystem engineers some researchers call them the chicken nuggets of the prairie if a prairie species eats meat it almost certainly eats prairie dogs without prairie dogs blackfooted ferrets would never survive outside zoos and breeding facilities and we would have far fewer mountain plovers burrowing owls swift foxes and ferruginous hawks before 1800 an estimated 5 billion prairie dogs lived from canada to mexico covering the west with underground apartment complexes that shifted over the centuries like sand dunes the lakota dakota and other indigenous peoples of the prairie shaped and depended on the ecosystems prairie dogs created some relied on prairie dogs for nourishment during thin times or used them as a ceremonial food but european settlers were remarkably effective at shooting and poisoning prairie dogs and plowing up their burrows today the five prairie dog species occupy just 2 of their historic range and some occupy even less prairie dogs still survive in many of their historic territories blacktailed prairie dogs known for their especially large dense colonies persist in isolated pockets of the prairie east of the rocky mountains from canada to mexico whitetailed prairie dogs live in parts of montana wyoming utah and colorado gunnisons prairie dogs eke out an existence in southern colorado and utah prairie dogs live in well utah mexican prairie dogs still hang on in small slices of northern mexico but many of these populations are

measures the animals acceleration and angle by triangulating with locations picked up by sensors posted on poles throughout the colony researchers can determine where and how far the prairie dogs travel both above and below ground the clairol dye patterns provide one more way to tell whos who in a colony of lookalikes though other researchers have studied prairie dogs aboveground lives no one really knows what they do underground satellite imagery can be used to track arctic terns over alaska or grizzly bears deep in the wilderness but it cant penetrate the earth decades ago researchers laboriously excavated a whitetailed prairie dog burrow in southern montana revealing features like sleeping quarters hibernacula and a maternity area but such work is invasive and yields little data on the animals movements at american prairie in september the smithsonian team was joined by researchers from swansea university in wales who had developed the tracking collars boulerice used the collars were originally designed to study penguins underwater an environment similarly resistant to conventional satellite tracking prairie dogs arent the only occupants of prairie dog burrows the mazes of tunnels and rooms also provide shelter for blackfooted ferrets swift foxes and untold numbers of insects burrowing owls shimmy their puffball bodies into the tunnels where they raise their chicks on the plentiful bugs prairie rattlesnakes tiger salamanders horned lizards and badgers use them too and as climate extremes become more common aboveground these burrows may become even more important by creating tunnels theyre also creating a thermal refuge said hila shamon the director of the smithsonians great plains science program and principal investigator of the colonymapping project the prairie can be so hot in the summer or brutally brutally cold in the winter you dont have any shade or place to hide from the cold and conditions in the tunnel systems are consistent prairie dogs spend much of the day and all night in their burrows living in family coteries composed of one male three or four females and the years young their tunnel systems which can extend across an area larger than a football field are like bustling apartment complexes where every family has its separate unit residents periodically pop out of doors to grab food gossip about the neighbors and scan for danger in the prairie shamon said theres a whole world thats happening beneath the ground that we cant see but it exists and its very deep and its important aboveground the effect of prairie dogs on the landscape is more obvious prairie dogs create an entirely novel habitat type said andy boyce a smithsonian research ecologist they graze intensely they increase the forbs and flowering plants and they clip woody vegetation they will eat and nibble on a new woody plant until it tips over and dies in the prairie theres a whole world thats happening beneath the ground that we cant see but it exists and its very deep and its important the landscape created by prairie dogs may look barren but the reality is more nuanced a healthy prairie isnt an uninterrupted sea of grass its made up of grass and shrubs wetlands and wildflowers and even large patches of bare dirt that allow prairie dogs and other species to spot approaching predators bison like to wallow in the dirt exposed by prairie dogs and graze on the nutritious grass and plants that resprout after a prairie dog pruning mountain plovers and thickbilled longspurs frequently nest on the grazed surface of prairie dog towns both birds have declined along with prairie dogs the mountain plover has been proposed for protection under the endangered species act prairie dog colonies may also provide other species with a homealarm system you have 1000 little pairs of eyeballs constantly searching for predators all around you and then vocalizing loudly when they see them boyce said to test this hypothesis boyces phd student andrew dreelin attached a taxidermied badger to a remotecontrolled car and drove it near longbilled curlew nests in montana prairie dog colonies he then measured how nesting curlews responded to the badger with and without a warning from the prairie dogs results are pending said dreelin but hes certain that weve only just started to scratch the surface on the multifaceted ways that prairie dogs could shape the lives of birds on the prairie in early october about 500 miles south of american prairie colten salyer also donned thick leather gloves to protect himself from an angry mammals teeth then he opened a cat carrier filled with paper shavings and a member of a species once considered extinct the young blackfooted ferret inside bared its long white canines bred at the national blackfooted ferret conservation center in northern colorado she was one of 20 about to be reintroduced to southcentral wyomings shirley basin the blackfooted ferret is north americas only native ferret and one of only three ferret species in the world and if theres one thing blackfooted ferrets need its prairie dogs they eat them almost exclusively and they use their tunnels to live hunt and reproduce slipping in and out of burrows as they move like water across the landscape in 1980 blackfooted ferrets were declared extinct most likely extinguished by disease development and endless prairie dog poisoning campaigns but in 1981 a northern wyoming ranch dog proudly presented his owners with his most recent treasure a dead ferret a local taxidermist confirmed that it was in fact a blackfooted ferret a member of a tiny remnant population the newly discovered ferrets lived in the wild until 1985 when biologists discovered that disease had killed all but 18 at that point they scooped up the remaining ferrets and took them to captive breeding facilities only seven successfully reproduced but those seven now have more than 11000 descendants in 2020 researchers used dna from a wildcaught ferret with no surviving offspring to produce the first cloned ferret since then they have created two more cloned individuals and this past november the us fish and wildlife service announced that one had given birth to healthy kits captivebred ferrets have now been released across the west but to survive longterm they need prairie dog colonies and prairie dogs arent popular with their human neighbors because they eat the same grass cows do and they make holes i was running to rope a yearling once and i stood up in the saddle and was about to open my hand and all of a sudden the horses front end disappeared said salyer a ranch manager in shirley basin who volunteered to help with the releases his horse had sunk a hoof into a prairie dog hole a misstep that sent salyer tumbling to the ground both salyer and his horse were fine and he shrugged after telling the storybut most ranchers have or have heard similar stories many of which end with a valued horse breaking a leg theres no way to know how frequently horses injure themselves in burrows but the stories spread as fast as a prairie fire whats certain is that prairie dogs eat grass quite a bit of grass a single prairie dog can devour up to 2 pounds of green grass and nonwoody plants every week according to montana state university for ranchers who use that vegetation to feed their cows prairie dogs look like competition researchers however say the effects of prairie dogs on livestock forage are mixed blacktailed prairie dogs propensity to clip and mow for instance results in plants with higher fat and protein and lower fiber across years enhanced forage quality may help to offset reductions in forage quantity for agricultural producers a study published in 2019 by rangeland ecology and management reported this uncertainty has led to some bureaucratic contradictions the wyoming department of agriculture labels prairie dogs as pest species and offers training in properly using pesticides to kill them at the same time the wyoming game and fish department lists the blacktailed prairie dog as a species of greatest conservation need until the 1990s said randy matchett a fish and wildlife service biologist in central montana prairie dogs were so despised in places like phillips county montana that the bureau of land management produced maps of their colonies designed for sport shooters attitudes havent changed much in 2020 27 years after an initial survey of attitudes toward blacktailed prairie dogs and blackfooted ferrets in montana researchers found that feelings about them had barely budged matchett said that when he tells his montana neighbors that only 2 of prairie dogs remain a common attitude is what the hells the holdup getting rid of that last 2 chamois andersen a defenders of wildlife senior field representative has spent decades working with landowners in prairie dogrich places and shes persuaded some to allow researchers to survey their land for blackfooted ferrets in exchange for funds for noxious weed removal she speculates that younger generations of ranchers are more open to prairie dog conservation and to partnerships with public agencies and wildlife groups matchett is less optimistic even the us forest service and national park service which together manage one of the largest blackfooted ferret colonies in the world in south dakotas conata basin poison some prairie dogs on federal land to prevent the population from moving onto private property not all prairie dogs are equally reviled whitetailed prairie dogs like those in shirley basin live at lower densities and tend to clip plants farther up the stems making them less obvious to the casual observer landowners as a result are often more tolerant of them than their blacktailed cousins said andrew gygli a smallcarnivore biologist for wyoming game and fish bob heward whose family started ranching in shirley basin more than a century ago understands that a disliked species can also be useful he invites recreational shooters to target prairie dogs on his land but he wont use poison to kill the rodents because he knows they provide food for other species prairie dogs are a nuisance he said but theyre also as inevitable as the wind weve learned to live with them theyve been here longer than i have randy matchett said that when he tells his montana neighbors that only 2 of prairie dogs remain a common attitude is what the hells the holdup getting rid of that last 2 the male swift fox at the end of the trap line was chunky at least by swift fox standards though he weighed only about 5 pounds his belly was round beneath his fluffy fur his black eyes carefully followed smithsonian researcher hila shamon as she loaded him into the backseat of her fourdoor pickup covering the trap with a blanket as she prepared to transport him from this ranch north of laramie wyoming to a new home on the fort belknap indian reservation in montana unlike blackfooted ferrets swift foxes can survive without prairie dogs but when prairie dogs are scarce they suffer from the loss of food shamon said and are deprived of the shelter they find in prairie dog burrows so they too declined as prairie dogs were exterminated and prairie habitat was converted into cropland by the early 1900s they had disappeared from canada montana north dakota nebraska kansas and oklahoma but swift foxes still live in parts of the west and in some places their populations are being restored for the last five years shamon and her team have trapped swift foxes in wyoming and colorado and trucked them to fort belknap this rectangle of grassland buttes and prairie breaks near the canadian border is home to the nakoda assiniboine and aaninin gros ventre both great plains peoples today it is one of the only places in the world where prairie dogs swift foxes blackfooted ferrets and bison coexist montana state sen mike fox gros ventre d who served as fort belknaps director of fish and wildlife from 1991 to 2001 oversaw early efforts to restore buffalo swift foxes and blackfooted ferrets to the reservation the goal was to create a steady healthy population of native animals that were driven to extinction because of the different uses of the land he said like when they started poisoning the prairie dogs off in the 30s and 40s and wiped out the ferrets that were native here and the same with the swift fox we want to make as complete an ecosystem as we can along with the buffalo the tribes worked with the fish and wildlife service to reintroduce blackfooted ferrets and with researchers at the smithsonian world wildlife fund and other organizations to bring back the swift fox the collaborators spent two years planning the swift fox capture and translocation shamon said considering factors like habitat quality community attitudes and the overall risk to a reestablished population swift foxes had already been reintroduced in parts of alberta and saskatchewan and on the blackfeet and fort peck reservations the reintroduction at fort belknap continued the tribes restoration efforts and added a possible point of connectivity for other populations tribal members living on and near the fort belknap reservation have largely supported the reintroduction of native prairie species especially after prairie dog numbers were diminished by an outbreak of disease in the late 90s fox said now that the population is recovering and has started to clear larger areas of grass however some tribal members who raise cattle have begun expressing frustration to the tribal council wildlife and cattle will graze prairie dog colonies because of the new growth coming back throughout the year said fox it makes it look even worse because its attractive to wildlife and domestic cattle and they do their part when it starts looking like a moonscape is when we get people noticing the most he tells people that the little grasseating rodents are necessary and notes that the moonscapes arent as widespread as they may seem but like nonnative ranchers across the west some tribal members equate abundant prairie dogs with fewer cows fox doesnt believe the council will allow widespread prairie dog poisoning on tribal lands especially since the reservation now hosts blackfooted ferrets but he does worry that opposition could intensify bronc speak thunder assiniboine director of the fort belknap buffalo program has also heard people complain about prairie dogs though he added that people complain about a lot of stuff the tribes arent actively restoring prairie dogs he said theyre simply refraining from poisoning and shooting them he sees that prairie dogs benefit tribal land by creating more habitat for groundnesting birds and serving as food for swift foxes coyotes hawks and eagles they also encourage the growth of nutritious grass for bison like life its a big circle and thats where it fits he said theyre part of the ecosystem that exists and if you take something out it throws everything off when i met randy matchett the fish and wildlife service biologist he sported a cowboy hat and graying horseshoe mustache and carried a handful of smurfblue fleacontrol pellets each slightly smaller than a marble the pellets which matchett produced in his workshop at the charles m russell national wildlife refuge headquarters in lewistown montana are his latest attempt to protect prairie dogs from a fatal disease the pellets contain fipronil an insecticide used in treatments likefrontline to keep fleas and ticks away from household pets and are flavored with peanut butter and molasses to increase their chances of ending up in prairie dog bellies matchett dyes them blue because research shows prairie dogs are attracted to the color and because the dye stains their feces making it easy to estimate how many animals have consumed the pellets once ingested matchett hopes his fipbits will kill the fleas that land on and bite prairie dogs including the fleas carrying the bacteria that causes plague yes that plague the bacteria yersinia pestis causes bubonic plague which became known as the black death after it killed at least 25 million europeans during the 14th century in 1900 the disease arrived in north america via san francisco carried by rats stowed away on ships during the following decades the development of antibiotics controlled the disease in humans but plague continued to spread among rodent species affecting blackfooted ferrets rabbits and squirrels first detected in prairie dogs in 1936 it devastated populations already hit hard by the conversion of the prairie to agriculture and it remains a major threat to prairie dogs once colonies have plague they can disappear in two weeks said shamon there will be thousands of acres chirping with thousands or tens of thousands of animals and in two weeks you will go map it and theyre gone a plague vaccine does exist and is used to protect highly endangered species like blackfooted ferrets but its simply not possible to jab every prairie dog in the west matchett who as a fish and wildlife biologist is responsible for conserving endangered species got involved in plague prevention in the early 1990s initially dusting prairie dog colonies for fleas in 2013 he began testing oral vaccines in montana colonies working in parallel with researchers in seven other states the firstgeneration vaccines were red peanutbutter flavored cubes with a biomarker that tinted prairie dog whiskers pink matchett and his colleagues in colorado also developed vaccine pellets that they massproduced using a lithuanian carp baitmaking machine matchett helped craft a pellet shooter that could be bolted to the front of a fourwheeler prairie dogs are part of the ecosystem that exists and if you take something out it throws everything off with the new vaccines primed to launch matchett felt hopeful the world wildlife fund which helped fund some of the work felt hopeful too but in 2018 after years of trials with thousands of prairie dogs he and other researchers concluded that even when a colony was given oral vaccinations the number of prairie dogs that survived a plague outbreak was too small to support a blackfooted ferret population so matchett pivoted if he couldnt inoculate prairie dogs against plague maybe he could kill the fleas that carried the bacteria what if he could persuade prairie dogs to eat fipronil he made a new set of pellets with the same bait machine this time using his wifes grandmothers kitchenaid mixer to blend various types of flour vital wheat gluten peanut butter molasses and other foodgrade ingredients with a soupçon of flea killer early results have been promising while adult fleas arent affected until they bite a prairie dog thats ingested a pellet not every flea needs to be killed studies have shown that in general fleas dont trigger plague outbreaks until they reach a critical mass and flea larvae appear to die when they crawl into or consume treated prairie dog poop suggesting that the pellets could tamp down flea reproduction as well as kill the adult insects fipbits arent the only way to reduce the toll plague takes on prairie dogs but matchett believes theyre the most likely to work in his office perched on stacks of files are the remnants of another of his many assaults on the problem dozens of vials of alcohol each containing bits of prairie dog ears in 2007 and 2008 matchett and his colleagues collected the snippets from prairie dogs that had survived plague outbreaks hoping genetic analysis would explain their fortitude the material has yet to be analyzed owing to a combination of lack of funding interest time and capability matchett said but he hopes new funding will allow him and his collaborators to return to the project despite the setbacks matchett believes researchers can find a way to control plague in prairie dogs human intolerance as he sees it is a more stubborn problem places like fort belknap and the conata basin of south dakota where prairie dogs are at least for now allowed to flourish remain few and far between drive south from fort belknap down highway 191 head east on a straight gravel road and youll find one more place where prairie dogs are left in peace american prairie began in 2001 as an effort to protect and restore montanas grasslands the nonprofit now manages more than 527000 acres of private land and federal and state leases its ultimate goal is to connect 32 million acres of prairie providing habitat for an array of species from bison to mountain plovers to blackfooted ferrets to the casual observer american prairies lands may already look like intact prairie though ecologists like daniel kinka cant help noticing the nonnative crested wheatgrass and the hundreds of miles of fencing this is kind of like the field of dreams model if you build it they will come said kinka american prairies director of rewilding a better habitat houses more wildlife and the wildlife that are here are perfectly capable of restoring themselves american prairie prohibits the poisoning and shooting of prairie dogs on its land and it regularly hosts research projects such as the smithsonians burrow mapping which may help explain how plague spreads within colonies and matchetts tests of plaguemitigation tools prairie dogs said kinka are the unsung heroes of a prairie ecosystem important to all the other species american prairie is trying to foster and as researchers have found the woody plants that prairie dogs chew down to clear their line of sight tend to be replaced by nutritious grasses and wildflowers suggesting that even cattle may benefit from their presence the possibility that prairie dogs could be good for cattle or at least not as bad as generally believed is met with skepticism by american prairies neighbors many of whom see the nonprofit as a threat to ranching signs posted along highways in phillips county montana read save the american cowboy stop american prairie reserve for now kinka isnt trying to convince anyone to like or even appreciate prairie dogs aiming instead for tolerance the blacktailed prairie dog complex studied by the smithsonian team at american prairie is a noisy place filled with the barks and trills of hundreds of creatures as i stood beside researcher jesse boulerice listening it was easy to imagine that the rodents were doing just fine but theyre not will they ever be allowed to exist in numbers like this throughout their historic range boulerice surveyed the surface of the colony which was covered with dried plant nubs and bare mounds of dirt and said he wasnt sure then he released a collared prairie dog who wagged her chubby butt in the air as she scurried into a nearby hole she promptly popped back up chirping out a message well never understand perhaps she was warning her colonymates to watch out for those marshmallows and carrots they hide a nasty trap or maybe she was scolding us telling us exactly what she thought of our species before she disappeared into her burrow leaving us to decide the future of hers,climate,0
Euronext reiterates corn mycotoxin limits after rainy French harvest,"Financial markets operator Euronext issued a notice on Thursday reiterating limits on mycotoxins in corn delivered against its futures contract, after a rainy harvest in France, reported Reuters.

Mycotoxins are toxic substances produced by mould on crops, often in damp conditions, and can cause sickness when consumed by humans and animals. Corn is mostly used in livestock feed.

Euronext, whose corn (maize) futures are a price benchmark for the European market, said it was reminding participants that it applies maximum levels set out in European Union regulations, including a limit of eight parts per million for deoxynivalenol (DON), a common mycotoxin.

""Due to the corn quality in France this year, especially concerning the level of mycotoxins, Euronext has been receiving several questions over the past few weeks about the specifications in our corn contract,"" the group added in an emailed response to Reuters.

""The communication sent this morning acts as a reminder of the specifications, to avoid any misunderstandings.""

Physical delivery for corn traded on Euronext mainly takes place in France, with just one delivery silo available outside the country, at Ghent in neighbouring Belgium.

Corn quality in France, the European Union's biggest grain producer, has been a market concern after heavy rain hampered autumn harvesting and traders cited reports of increased presence of mycotoxins.

However, unlike wheat, for which French production slumped to its lowest since the 1980s, the country's corn output is estimated to have risen sharply with rain helping growth during summer.",2025-01-10,financial markets operator euronext issued a notice on thursday reiterating limits on mycotoxins in corn delivered against its futures contract after a rainy harvest in france reported reuters mycotoxins are toxic substances produced by mould on crops often in damp conditions and can cause sickness when consumed by humans and animals corn is mostly used in livestock feed euronext whose corn maize futures are a price benchmark for the european market said it was reminding participants that it applies maximum levels set out in european union regulations including a limit of eight parts per million for deoxynivalenol don a common mycotoxin due to the corn quality in france this year especially concerning the level of mycotoxins euronext has been receiving several questions over the past few weeks about the specifications in our corn contract the group added in an emailed response to reuters the communication sent this morning acts as a reminder of the specifications to avoid any misunderstandings physical delivery for corn traded on euronext mainly takes place in france with just one delivery silo available outside the country at ghent in neighbouring belgium corn quality in france the european unions biggest grain producer has been a market concern after heavy rain hampered autumn harvesting and traders cited reports of increased presence of mycotoxins however unlike wheat for which french production slumped to its lowest since the 1980s the countrys corn output is estimated to have risen sharply with rain helping growth during summer,climate,0
Marigold Bagels rides TikTok fame to new storefront in North Park,"On Dec. 29, Marigold Bagels sold its last bagel at the Mission Valley Farmers Market in Civita Park. But don't panic! The popular New York-style bagels will still be available online and will return later this year to Civita Park and to a new storefront in North Park.

My friend introduced me to Marigold Bagels by sneaking one in a brown paper bag into a cinema on a Sunday morning. In the dark, I tore apart the bagel, ate it plain, and was immediately impressed. So impressed that I got up at 4 a.m. (that's actually a late start for a bagel maker) on a Saturday morning to find out how these amazing bagels were made.

Mike Rabinowitz, founder, owner and sole bagel maker at Marigold Bagels, wanted to bring New York-style bagels to San Diego. He began making them in his home kitchen -- 138 bagels cold-fermented in his refrigerator, leaving little room for food, so he ate out a lot. Then he expanded to a professional kitchen and has been selling bagels online and at Civita Park for almost two years.

But back in November, a TikTok video from a loyal customer ignited a change.

""She said, 'Mike, I just posted this, you better get ready.' Well, it turns out she had over 20,000 followers in San Diego, and it went viral. And then, the next time we showed up at the market, we went from maybe 20 people in line at any given time to, we counted about 250,"" Rabinowitz recalled.

This prompted Rabinowitz to ramp up to full capacity.

""When I say full capacity, I mean literally as much as I can carry in my truck. I can't carry one more tray of bagels,"" Rabinowitz said.

This, of course, made me wonder if he might need armed guards to protect the precious and very limited cargo.

Even at full capacity, he was making only 580 bagels. That meant a lot of people left without any bagels, and Rabinowitz felt awful. So, for the final weeks of 2024, he instituted some new policies: a limit of seven bagels per person and a deli ticketing system to manage customers' expectations. Green numbers meant you were guaranteed a bagel, yellow numbers meant maybe and red numbers meant you were unlikely to succeed in your quest for a Marigold bagel.

He also ramped up online sales, but trying to get a bagel became akin to trying to get a Comic-Con badge.

""I would say within five to seven minutes, they were all gone,"" Rabinowitz said. ""And that produces a lot of very unhappy people who are online fighting everyone else online. Even though I knew we'd get a storefront eventually, it became all the more important to do so quickly because we can go from baking and selling twice a week to every day of the week.""

That will be a big relief. Of course, it also means hiring more people, doing more work and making a lot more bagels at a location completely dedicated to his business. He pointed out that he lost an entire batch of bagels once because someone sharing the community fridge took his trays out and left them in the hallway. They overproofed, ballooned and became unusable. But that kind of kitchen disaster won't happen at his new storefront, which is why he is excited about the future of Marigold Bagels.

Matt Eisenberg was in line by 7:45 a.m. on a chilly Saturday morning last month to make sure he got a bagel.

""I was born in New York. My parents are from New York, and I've been having his bagels for over a year now,"" Eisenberg said. ""It's really hard to find a perfect bagel. His everything bagel is delicious. He's tried things with za'atar, which is a really delicious type of seasoning. They really live up to the hype: The freshness and the doughiness. They are authentic New York bagels.""

And that was Rabinowitz's vision -- to bring authentic New York bagels, the ones he remembered as a kid, to San Diego.

""The best ones are high gluten, they're baked the same day, they have a bit of a chew to the crust, but a soft sort of mouthfeel,"" Rabinowitz explained. ""When I was a kid growing up on Long Island, the bagels were very similar to what I make now: the crispy crust, the high gluten, little bit smaller, blistered surfaces from the long cold ferments. I watch David Tamarkin's video all the time and how they used to make them in New York in Lower East Side in 1924.""

And with the storefront, Rabinowitz wants to create something else authentic: ""I want to sort of recreate what you could have found many years ago on the Lower East Side of New York. Big baskets of bagels and offer the real sort of classic New York bagel sandwiches, which among other things involve different kinds of cream cheese, and smoked or cured fish, like lox. So, it gives people the feeling that they're actually at a bagel shop in New York.""

As a New Yorker, Rabinowitz is familiar with the adage that it's the New York water that makes the bagels so special. But as a recently retired organic chemist, he wasn't going to accept that as fact. So, at JFK Airport in New York, he smuggled some New York tap water home and conducted a scientific test with six self-defined foodie friends.

""I made three batches of bagels exactly the same way, except one had New York tap water, one had San Diego tap water and the other one had the soft water we use, and just made plain bagels. We did a blind taste test, and people had a lot of opinions, but there was no consensus on what the best bagel was. I could tell the difference between the San Diego tap water and the New York tap water, but I couldn't tell the difference between New York tap water and the filtered reverse osmosis water that we use,"" Rabinowitz explained.

His background in organic chemistry turned out to be surprisingly useful in the kitchen.

""Organic chemistry really involves working in the laboratory and controlling temperature, time, humidity and the way you add -- we call them starting materials and products -- but here, they're ingredients,"" Rabinowitz said. ""The way you add them, the quality of what you use, that's all drilled into your head about how you do chemistry. And it turns out that all those things are important in baking. I'm not and never was trained as a baker. I would call myself a bagel maker.""

""I have hundreds and hundreds of test batches and pages in a notebook,"" Rabinowitz said. ""Each one describes how I made it, the batch, the ingredients I used, where they're from, times and temperatures, pictures, and then the final results of what I thought of it and what I thought could be improved. Eventually, I got to the recipe we follow now and the techniques we follow now.""

Rabinowitz's passion for bagel-making extends beyond the science.

""I could talk about this forever, so it gets a little dull,"" he joked.

It might be dull, except that Rabinowitz's enthusiasm for the art and science of making a bagel-making is contagious. Plus, he offered me a za'atar bagel fresh from the oven, which I tore apart and dipped in a specialty cream cheese made by Courtney Schwatrz, his business development and marketing manager. She was drawn into the kitchen by Rabinowitz's passion.

When Rabinowitz retired, he never expected to be up and making bagels by 3 a.m. or on his feet for nearly eight hours on baking and sales days. The repetitive motion of rolling and twisting the dough has even given him tendinitis, a move he likened to a screwball pitcher.

But is there a secret ingredient or technique that makes Marigold Bagels so special?

""There's no secret recipe,"" Rabinowitz stated. ""I don't use anything that no one else uses. I don't use any technique that no one else uses. What I did do was assimilate lots of ideas from people I saw online, books I read, articles I read and cookbooks. I took what I thought were the best ideas and discarded the ones that I thought were terrible -- and there there were quite a few -- and slowly developed this. I don't use dough enhancers. I spent my time just using the basic ingredients that we use: high protein wheat flour, barley malt, malt syrup, cane sugar, salt, yeast. That's pretty much it. And I think it's a better product for it.""

Rabinowitz, who has self-financed his business, never started Marigold Bagels to make money.

""It was honestly about bringing something to San Diego that I thought would add to the richness of the food scene,"" he said. ""I thought that this could add a little variety to the bagels available in general. When I hear from customers and on Instagram about how much they like the bagels, that probably gives me more happiness than selling the bagels themselves.""

Marigold Bagels plans to continue selling bagels online with pick-ups in Point Loma, and possibly more locations in the future. While they've paused appearances at the Mission Valley Farmers Market, they plan to return. Their storefront, located in North Park near El Cajon Blvd. and 30th Street, is expected to open in May or June.",2025-01-10,on dec 29 marigold bagels sold its last bagel at the mission valley farmers

expanded to a professional kitchen and has been selling bagels online and at civita park for almost two years but back in november a tiktok video from a loyal customer ignited a change she said mike i just posted this you better get ready well it turns out she had over 20000 followers in san diego and it went viral and then the next time we showed up at the market we went from maybe 20 people in line at any given time to we counted about 250 rabinowitz recalled this prompted rabinowitz to ramp up to full capacity when i say full capacity i mean literally as much as i can carry in my truck i cant carry one more tray of bagels rabinowitz said this of course made me wonder if he might need armed guards to protect the precious and very limited cargo even at full capacity he was making only 580 bagels that meant a lot of people left without any bagels and rabinowitz felt awful so for the final weeks of 2024 he instituted some new policies a limit of seven bagels per person and a deli ticketing system to manage customers expectations green numbers meant you were guaranteed a bagel yellow numbers meant maybe and red numbers meant you were unlikely to succeed in your quest for a marigold bagel he also ramped up online sales but trying to get a bagel became akin to trying to get a comiccon badge i would say within five to seven minutes they were all gone rabinowitz said and that produces a lot of very unhappy people who are online fighting everyone else online even though i knew wed get a storefront eventually it became all the more important to do so quickly because we can go from baking and selling twice a week to every day of the week that will be a big relief of course it also means hiring more people doing more work and making a lot more bagels at a location completely dedicated to his business he pointed out that he lost an entire batch of bagels once because someone sharing the community fridge took his trays out and left them in the hallway they overproofed ballooned and became unusable but that kind of kitchen disaster wont happen at his new storefront which is why he is excited about the future of marigold bagels matt eisenberg was in line by 745 am on a chilly saturday morning last month to make sure he got a bagel i was born in new york my parents are from new york and ive been having his bagels for over a year now eisenberg said its really hard to find a perfect bagel his everything bagel is delicious hes tried things with zaatar which is a really delicious type of seasoning they really live up to the hype the freshness and the doughiness they are authentic new york bagels and that was rabinowitzs vision to bring authentic new york bagels the ones he remembered as a kid to san diego the best ones are high gluten theyre baked the same day they have a bit of a chew to the crust but a soft sort of mouthfeel rabinowitz explained when i was a kid growing up on long island the bagels were very similar to what i make now the crispy crust the high gluten little bit smaller blistered surfaces from the long cold ferments i watch david tamarkins video all the time and how they used to make them in new york in lower east side in 1924 and with the storefront rabinowitz wants to create something else authentic i want to sort of recreate what you could have found many years ago on the lower east side of new york big baskets of bagels and offer the real sort of classic new york bagel sandwiches which among other things involve different kinds of cream cheese and smoked or cured fish like lox so it gives people the feeling that theyre actually at a bagel shop in new york as a new yorker rabinowitz is familiar with the adage that its the new york water that makes the bagels so special but as a recently retired organic chemist he wasnt going to accept that as fact so at jfk airport in new york he smuggled some new york tap water home and conducted a scientific test with six selfdefined foodie friends i made three batches of bagels exactly the same way except one had new york tap water one had san diego tap water and the other one had the soft water we use and just made plain bagels we did a blind taste test and people had a lot of opinions but there was no consensus on what the best bagel was i could tell the difference between the san diego tap water and the new york tap water but i couldnt tell the difference between new york tap water and the filtered reverse osmosis water that we use rabinowitz explained his background in organic chemistry turned out to be surprisingly useful in the kitchen organic chemistry really involves working in the laboratory and controlling temperature time humidity and the way you add we call them starting materials and products but here theyre ingredients rabinowitz said the way you add them the quality of what you use thats all drilled into your head about how you do chemistry and it turns out that all those things are important in baking im not and never was trained as a baker i would call myself a bagel maker i have hundreds and hundreds of test batches and pages in a notebook rabinowitz said each one describes how i made it the batch the ingredients i used where theyre from times and temperatures pictures and then the final results of what i thought of it and what i thought could be improved eventually i got to the recipe we follow now and the techniques we follow now rabinowitzs passion for bagelmaking extends beyond the science i could talk about this forever so it gets a little dull he joked it might be dull except that rabinowitzs enthusiasm for the art and science of making a bagelmaking is contagious plus he offered me a zaatar bagel fresh from the oven which i tore apart and dipped in a specialty cream cheese made by courtney schwatrz his business development and marketing manager she was drawn into the kitchen by rabinowitzs passion when rabinowitz retired he never expected to be up and making bagels by 3 am or on his feet for nearly eight hours on baking and sales days the repetitive motion of rolling and twisting the dough has even given him tendinitis a move he likened to a screwball pitcher but is there a secret ingredient or technique that makes marigold bagels so special theres no secret recipe rabinowitz stated i dont use anything that no one else uses i dont use any technique that no one else uses what i did do was assimilate lots of ideas from people i saw online books i read articles i read and cookbooks i took what i thought were the best ideas and discarded the ones that i thought were terrible and there there were quite a few and slowly developed this i dont use dough enhancers i spent my time just using the basic ingredients that we use high protein wheat flour barley malt malt syrup cane sugar salt yeast thats pretty much it and i think its a better product for it rabinowitz who has selffinanced his business never started marigold bagels to make money it was honestly about bringing something to san diego that i thought would add to the richness of the food scene he said i thought that this could add a little variety to the bagels available in general when i hear from customers and on instagram about how much they like the bagels that probably gives me more happiness than selling the bagels themselves marigold bagels plans to continue selling bagels online with pickups in point loma and possibly more locations in the future while theyve paused appearances at the mission valley farmers market they plan to return their storefront located in north park near el cajon blvd and 30th street is expected to open in may or june,climate,0
Flying toward a cleaner future,"The report detailed the challenges facing decarbonisation of the aviation sector, as the pace of the clean energy transition accelerates nationally and globally.

Emissions generated by Australia's aviation industry are larger than the country's bus and truck emissions combined. If unmanaged, aviation will continue to emit carbon dioxide (CO2) at an alarming rate and slow the pace to net zero. Addressing this sector's emissions reduction is critical.

Before COVID-19 impacted air travel globally, national and international flights to and from Australia accounted for 5% of the country's total emissions pool. These numbers are starting to re-emerge as Australia and the world resume pre-COVID-19 airflight patterns.

According to a report from the CSIRO, domestic aviation emissions in Australia tripled from 1990 to 2019. Projections show by 2050 the domestic demand for jet fuel will increase by 75%. This is because domestic travel includes business and trade, national defence, cargo transportation and other sectors. The result of this increase will be a rise in emissions from domestic flights.

Aeroplane emissions is a challenge that requires innovation and solutions to decarbonise. In 2023, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) launched its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Funding Initiative to do just that.

Aviation is considered a difficult sector to decarbonise with SAF considered to contribute between 45-70% of the sector's decarbonisation efforts by 2050.

With $30 million of funding to allocate, the initiative's aim is to focus on decarbonising the aviation sector, support development of a domestic SAF industry and identify projects that could boost future supply.

SAF explained

SAF is a drop-in fuel. This means it can blend with conventional jet fuel in existing aeroplanes without modification. Currently, SAF is approximately 2 to 4 times the cost of conventional jet fuel and in low supply globally.

SAF is produced by converting a specific raw material, referred to as feedstock, that is turned into a cleaner fuel through a production process. Some SAF technologies produce commercial volumes globally, while several emerging technologies are still at pre-commercial stage.

Feedstock like vegetable oil (canola and soybean), waste oils (cooking oil) and fats such as tallow are currently used in the following SAF pathways:

Because these feedstocks are widely traded, with limited capacity for increased production, it can create a pressure on price and may limit the scale of production.

These emerging technologies typically use waste feedstock like household rubbish (red bin waste), agricultural crops and residues from sugarcane, wheat and other crop production. Feedstock like this presents a larger opportunity to scale production overtime because the feedstock is in higher supply.

You can read more here to find out about the different types of SAF and the feedstock used in those processes.

For use commercially and in aeroplanes, production pathways for SAF must undergo strict testing standards. The standards and certification ensure it's safe to use and gives guidelines of how much SAF can blend with conventional jet fuel. Currently, there are 11 pathways approved for use in aviation.

Sustainability in SAF

SAF must be sustainable for the environment and meet supply demands. To meet this criteria SAF must not deplete natural resources, can be continuously and repeatedly replenished and produces fewer carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel.

Life cycle analysis must be done to determine emissions impact of SAF processes. The analysis considers the full emissions impact from producing SAF. After the analysis, the information will be used to compare against the extraction of crude oil and production of conventional jet fuel to see SAF's impact on reducing emissions.

A United Nations body known as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), has also established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to support the industries development.

CORSIA provides a framework and guidance on minimum standards and sustainability requirements for SAF production. It will be necessary to have CORSIA, along with other standards and certification, to hold the SAF sector to a high standard when validating and verifying emissions reductions claims.

With $9 million in funding from ARENA, Jet Zero Australia will explore the viability of its commercial scale alcohol-to-jet low carbon liquid fuel (LCLF) production facility in Townsville, Queensland. The purpose is to explore the technical and commercial readiness of SAF technologies.

The project will include $36.8 million for the front-end engineering design (FEED) as a part of the study.

Once it gets to deployment stage, Project Ulysses could:

In 2025, the FEED portion of Project Ulysses should be complete.

Two more projects for the SAF books

ARENA is also providing $8 million in funding to Ampol and $6.1 million to GrainCorp for separate studies to develop renewable fuel alternatives for Australia's airline industry.

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said these projects represent an important step towards developing a pipeline of projects that could support the reduction of aviation sector emissions.

'Aviation is a persistently challenging industry from an emissions reduction perspective,' Mr Miller said.

'With Australians being among the most prolific flyers in the world, decarbonising this high emissions industry will be vital for us to achieve our net zero targets.

'These two projects are an important step towards developing opportunities to cut emissions from Australian skies and ARENA will be working to ensure the lessons from these projects help inform the broader development of a sustainable aviation fuels industry in Australia.'

Ampol and GrainCorp recently entered a Memorandum of Understanding to explore the establishment of an integrated renewable fuels industry in Australia.

SAF, Aviation and ARENA's transport portfolio

The SAF funding initiative is a crucial step to begin unpacking and delivering advancements in domestic SAF production.

Ready to eat healthy? 5 ways to cut UPF in the New Year,"It's been in the news a lot, most recently because of California Gov. Gavin Newsom's just-issued executive order requiring agencies to ""crack down on ultra-processed foods and further investigate food dyes."" He issued the order because of growing concern about UPF's health harms.

So if your New Year's resolutions for 2025 center on cutting back on UPF consumption, you're not alone. Ideally it will become second nature, with habits you can practice throughout the year and beyond.

What are ultra-processed foods?

The term ""ultra-processed"" includes the kinds of packaged treats loved by nearly everyone, particularly kids: fruit yogurt, granola and other snack bars, breakfast cereal, frozen dinners, energy drinks and soda, and other packaged foods.

UPF are defined as containing ingredients not normally found in a home kitchen - chemicals whose names most people can't pronounce, such as artificial flavors, colors and sweeteners, preservatives, thickeners, stabilizers and emulsifiers. They're also often higher in calories, sodium and saturated fat.

So it's not surprising they're considered unhealthy to consume in large quantities. Study after study links consumption of UPF to a higher risk of health problems, including heart disease, obesity and Type 2 diabetes, and mental health issues such as depression.

But these foods, with their bright, fun packaging, novel taste sensations and sheer convenience, can be tough to resist. They may even be addictive. The proof: Most Americans' daily calories come from UPF.

Start fresh with food in 2025

But the prospect of swapping out those easy snacktime treats for more simple, less processed foods can seem overwhelming. (Especially if you have no idea what to eat instead.)

If that describes your predicament, we have a few ideas for getting started. Pick any one of them and take the plunge.

1. Avoid all-or-nothing thinking

Even those most adamant about UPF harms agree it's unlikely most people will go cold turkey. Many suggest that's an unrealistic and unnecessary goal.

Fill up with unprocessed and less-processed foods, such as beans and lentils, whole grains, and fresh fruit and vegetables. You'll have less appetite for UPF and before long, your desire for them will subside.

Kids may resist at first, and that's OK. It's even more important to avoid black-and-white thinking about what your children eat and instead focus on incremental change, since their developing bodies make them particularly vulnerable to toxic chemicals' health harms.

2. Cut down on fizzy drinks (or avoid them entirely)

Sugary drinks such as soda contain a huge amount of sugar. A 12-ounce soda contains more than what's recommended daily for women and about the same amount recommended for men.

Artificial sweeteners have been associated with a range of health harms, so diet drinks bring their own risks. Plus, studies show these drinks may be counterproductive - they can lead to weight gain.

Do what you can to cut back on sugary and artificially sweetened drinks, especially how much you give your kids.

The best beverage is plain water, maybe with some lemon squeezed into it. Herbal tea and carbonated water are good choices, too.

3. Snack better

Even ""healthy"" snack foods like some yogurts and granola bars aren't always as great for eating on the playground or during a shopping trip as we'd like to think. Fruit-sweetened yogurt from the grocery store, for instance, is often ultra-processed, containing harmful food chemicals, including artificial colorants.

As an alternative, add chopped fruit or nuts to plain yogurt and maybe even a small amount of juice or other sweeteners.

Cut-up fresh fruit or vegetables, nuts and whole grain crackers are also great portable snacks. Even better: Add a favorite spice or spice blend.

4. Study ingredient labels

It's important to know what you're eating, and that's often spelled out on ingredients lists.

Focus on products with ingredients whose names you recognize. In general, it's best to avoid foods containing stabilizers and preservatives as well as artificial colors, flavors, textures and sweeteners, among other chemicals.

This is especially true of products in a few specific categories, such as processed meat, instant soup, pizza and other frozen foods, and breakfast cereal.

On the other hand, some foods commonly seen as healthy - think 100 percent whole wheat bread, plain yogurt, and whole grain cereal - are also classified as ultra-processed but are healthy. You can tell the difference by looking at the ingredients label.

5. Make changes gradually

As with many new habits, change happens best when it's incremental. Don't try to overhaul the way you eat overnight. Consider making just one of these changes. Give yourself time to adjust to new habits before tackling another idea on the list.

What's ahead for UPF

There shouldn't be any question about whether our food contains toxic chemicals. But the federal government has failed to protect us, allowing companies to approve harmful food chemicals without oversight from the Food and Drug Administration.

In response, states are stepping into the regulatory gap, and EWG is supporting them every step of the way. We successfully led efforts to ban artificial food dyes in California, setting an important precedent for other states.

And companies are making formulation changes under market pressure fueled by the groundswell of skepticism about UPF.

What you can do

For more than 30 years, EWG's research and resources have helped consumers stay informed, so you can make safer, healthier choices.

Column-Will USDA data dump spoil the bullish party for corn? -Braun By Reuters,"NAPERVILLE, Illinois (Reuters) - If anything can derail a price rally, it is a curveball from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Chicago corn futures have ticked slightly lower to start the year, but they had climbed nearly 12% in the final two months of 2024, an unusually strong late-year run.

Speculators now hold their most bullish corn view in two years, and luckily for them, the trade has already accepted that last year's U.S. corn yield was a whopper.

Friday will feature USDA's biggest data release of the year, with primary focus on the most recent U.S. corn and soybean harvests. U.S. quarterly stocks, U.S. winter wheat seedings and routine global supply and demand updates will also compete for attention.

U.S. CORN AND BEANS

On average, analysts peg U.S. corn yield at 182.7 bushels per acre, down from 183.1 in November. The trade estimate is more than 5 bushels above last year's record and above USDA's initial trendline yield for the first time in six years.

Bearish yield outcomes are less likely when the estimates are already large, and only four of 19 polled analysts see corn yield rising from November. However, the range of trade estimates (2.4 bpa) is smaller than usual, flagging the potential for surprise.

In the last decade, analysts anticipated the wrong direction of U.S. corn yield in January only once (2019). They did so three times for soybean yield (2016, 2019, 2022).

But bets are somewhat off for U.S. soybean yield outcomes because USDA's slashing of the forecast in November was the month's largest cut in 31 years. Trade estimates indicate some uncertainty around U.S. soybean production as the ranges for both yield and harvested area are historically wide.

Regardless, U.S. soybean supplies are expected to remain ample and at multi-year highs. However, USDA last month pegged 2024-25 U.S. corn ending stocks below the prior year's level for the first time.

If USDA cuts U.S. corn ending stocks on Friday as expected, it would be the agency's seventh consecutive monthly reduction. Such a streak has not been observed in at least two decades, reflective of the strong demand that has recently lifted corn prices.

From a market reaction standpoint, these demand dynamics could be somewhat insulating if the U.S. corn crop comes in larger than expected. The last two times CBOT corn had a distinctly negative reaction on January report day were 2012 and 2024, the latter sparked by a huge yield above all trade estimates.

U.S. WHEAT

USDA will not officially issue 2025-26 outlooks until May, but the wheat market will receive its first piece of 2025-26 U.S. crop intel on Friday with the winter wheat planting survey. Total (EPA:TTEF) U.S. winter wheat acres are pegged at 33.37 million, very close to both last year and the five-year average.

Analysts have had a rough time anticipating the planting survey in the last two years, coming in almost 1.4 million acres too high last year but lowballing by nearly 2.5 million acres in 2023.

Wheat traders have struggled to find viable bullish narratives despite wheat stocks among major exporters seen dropping to 17-year lows, so another big miss in the U.S. wheat acreage could either support or undermine the recent sentiment.

SOUTH AMERICA

The U.S. crops will probably dominate the headlines on Friday, but it is not too early to watch out for forecast changes in South America. Analysts see USDA upping Brazil's 2024-25 soybean harvest to a record 170.28 million metric tons from the previous 169 million.

USDA has increased Brazil's soy crop in three of the last eight Januarys, both on area and yield improvements, and many industry participants have already been factoring in a number north of 170 million tons.

For Argentina, there are already fears that ongoing dry weather could eventually warrant more significant cuts to soybean and corn crops than are anticipated for Friday. American and European weather model runs on Thursday remained stingy with the rainfall over the next two weeks.

Will USDA data dump spoil the bullish party for corn? -Braun,"By Karen Braun

NAPERVILLE, Illinois, Jan 9 (Reuters) - If anything can derail a price rally, it is a curveball from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Chicago corn futures have ticked slightly lower to start the year, but they had climbed nearly 12% in the final two months of 2024, an unusually strong late-year run.

Speculators now hold their most bullish corn view in two years, and luckily for them, the trade has already accepted that last year´s U.S. corn yield was a whopper.

Friday will feature USDA´s biggest data release of the year, with primary focus on the most recent U.S. corn and soybean harvests. U.S. quarterly stocks, U.S. winter wheat seedings and routine global supply and demand updates will also compete for attention.

U.S. CORN AND BEANS

On average, analysts peg U.S. corn yield at 182.7 bushels per acre, down from 183.1 in November. The trade estimate is more than 5 bushels above last year´s record and above USDA´s initial trendline yield for the first time in six years.

Bearish yield outcomes are less likely when the estimates are already large, and only four of 19 polled analysts see corn yield rising from November. However, the range of trade estimates (2.4 bpa) is smaller than usual, flagging the potential for surprise.

In the last decade, analysts anticipated the wrong direction of U.S. corn yield in January only once (2019). They did so three times for soybean yield (2016, 2019, 2022).

But bets are somewhat off for U.S. soybean yield outcomes because USDA´s slashing of the forecast in November was the month´s largest cut in 31 years. Trade estimates indicate some uncertainty around U.S. soybean production as the ranges for both yield and harvested area are historically wide.

Regardless, U.S. soybean supplies are expected to remain ample and at multi-year highs. However, USDA last month pegged 2024-25 U.S. corn ending stocks below the prior year´s level for the first time.

If USDA cuts U.S. corn ending stocks on Friday as expected, it would be the agency´s seventh consecutive monthly reduction. Such a streak has not been observed in at least two decades, reflective of the strong demand that has recently lifted corn prices.

From a market reaction standpoint, these demand dynamics could be somewhat insulating if the U.S. corn crop comes in larger than expected. The last two times CBOT corn had a distinctly negative reaction on January report day were 2012 and 2024, the latter sparked by a huge yield above all trade estimates.

U.S. WHEAT

USDA will not officially issue 2025-26 outlooks until May, but the wheat market will receive its first piece of 2025-26 U.S. crop intel on Friday with the winter wheat planting survey. Total U.S. winter wheat acres are pegged at 33.37 million, very close to both last year and the five-year average.

Analysts have had a rough time anticipating the planting survey in the last two years, coming in almost 1.4 million acres too high last year but lowballing by nearly 2.5 million acres in 2023.

Wheat traders have struggled to find viable bullish narratives despite wheat stocks among major exporters seen dropping to 17-year lows, so another big miss in the U.S. wheat acreage could either support or undermine the recent sentiment.

SOUTH AMERICA

The U.S. crops will probably dominate the headlines on Friday, but it is not too early to watch out for forecast changes in South America. Analysts see USDA upping Brazil´s 2024-25 soybean harvest to a record 170.28 million metric tons from the previous 169 million.

USDA has increased Brazil´s soy crop in three of the last eight Januarys, both on area and yield improvements, and many industry participants have already been factoring in a number north of 170 million tons.

For Argentina, there are already fears that ongoing dry weather could eventually warrant more significant cuts to soybean and corn crops than are anticipated for Friday. American and European weather model runs on Thursday remained stingy with the rainfall over the next two weeks.

USDA already hiked Argentina´s soybean output last month on higher area. The agency increased the crop last January but reduced it in the prior three Januarys. Current crop conditions are slightly worse than a year ago but better than in the prior three years. Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters. Views expressed above are her own.

Gulf investors interested in livestock sector: CM,"Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has said that many big businessmen from the Gulf countries want to invest in the livestock sector in the province.

Addressing the launching ceremony of the Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif Livestock Card in Pakpattan, she said, ""We want to build 500,000 houses in the coming five years. We want to increase the amount for building houses from Rs1.5 million to Rs2 million. We are going to launch metro bus projects in Gujranwala and Faisalabad next year. We will give interest-free loans to the youth for employment.""

She added, ""Farmers will have access to modern agricultural machinery on rent in every tehsil. Farmers of Punjab are very happy to get rid of middlemen. After many decades, fertiliser was not sold at inflated price, it was easily available at the fixed rates.""

The chief minister said the target of wheat cultivation in the province had been achieved.

She said production of livestock vaccine at the local level would be increased.

""Not only some animals, but also some humans get foot-and-mouth disease. When they open their mouths, they do not talk except hurling abuses. We are improving in the quality of livestock and their breed,"" she added.

Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said animal tagging with QR code would be carried out across Punjab.

She said, ""I felt overjoyed to meet the farmer brothers and sisters who have obtained the Livestock Cards..Those who have obtained the cards also include students who are raising animals as a side business. It is a matter of joy that women have also obtained Livestock Cards.""

She expressed hope that expansion of the scheme would usher in.prosperity of the people.

She added, ""After the tenure of Nawaz Sharif, which was ended in 2017, good news have started coming to Pakistan now.""

The chief minister said the economy had begun recovering.

""The public first starts getting advantages of a project and then I come for its launching. The people have received money from the Livestock Card and I have come to meet them.""

She said inflation had declined significantly and the price of flour and bread in Punjab was lower than other provinces. ""I discuss the price of bread with my team on a daily basis. I will not let the price of bread to increase as 150 million people have to eat bread, I will do whatever I can in this regard. The economy is improving and the people have started getting its fruits. If inflation is lowered then the economy will improve and purchasing power of people will improve as well,"" she said.

The CM said Rs270,000 would be paid for four months to those having 10 or less animals through the Livestock Card. If the health and weight of the animals are good, the production and quality of meat and milk will improve.

What this week's cold means for farmers,"A nasty dose of winter weather has pummeled much of the U.S. from Kansas to the East Coast, leaving many Americans to dig out of the blizzard -- including farmers. And more is on the way, with the polar air expected to continue to grip some places until at least Friday.

Farmers always watch the weather, but depending on where they're located and what they produce, winter always presents mental challenges for growers, said Carolyn Olson, an organic farmer in southwestern Minnesota who is also vice president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors.

Producers know that the timing and amount of winter moisture affect farming conditions for the rest of the year. It's also a time for planning ahead -- something becoming increasingly difficult as climate change ramps up variability in snowfall, rainfall and other weather conditions that can make or break an operation.

""They're doing that stressful part of making those decisions on how they're going to farm this year, what they're going to grow,"" Olson said. ""It's just a lot of pressure on agriculture at this time of the year.""

Livestock producers dealing with 'generational storm'

Biting wind and big drifts from almost a whole year's average snowfall in a single storm are hitting farmers in some parts of Kansas ""in ways that we haven't seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a lifetime,"" said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State University who developed an animal comfort tool. It includes an index of heat and cold that a farmer can use -- along with their knowledge of their animals' age, coat, overall health and so forth -- to watch for situations when they may need to get animals out of dangerous areas.

The risk is real: Calves, especially, can die when temperatures slip below zero. And so much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from reaching herds with food and water, Redmond said.

That means preparing by moving animals and having a plan to care for them ahead of time is key -- which is harder due to the unpredictability of climate change. And not having the right experience or infrastructure to prepare is ""really, really stressful on producers,"" Redmond said.

Reprieve for some typically snowy areas

The storm missed some states further north like Iowa and Minnesota that are generally more accustomed to snow. Stu Swanson, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said that eases tasks like moving grain and working with livestock.

He added that without snow cover, the ground is more likely to freeze and thaw in a way that could benefit soils. Two years of drought followed by torrential rains last spring created tire ruts and compaction from farm machinery in some places, he said. He hopes that without as much snow, the freeze-thaw cycle will loosen up the soil and farmers may get the added bonus of some pests dying off before the spring.

""We don't have any growing crop now, so really temperature doesn't matter. We look forward to a good freeze,"" Swanson said.

'Feast or famine': Extremes and unpredictability worry some farmers

The lack of snow is a greater concern farther north in some parts of Minnesota, where producers do have winter crops like alfalfa or winter wheat.

Reliable snow cover is important in those areas because it insulates soil from cold. A few of inches of snow on top of a field can keep winter wheat's crown (which is still underground this time of year to withstand the winter) at 28 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius) even if the air temperature is as low as minus 40 Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius), said Jochum Wiersma, an extension professor at the University of Minnesota.

""There's not a lot you can do, unfortunately,"" when ice breaks a plant's crown, said Martin Larsen, who grows alfalfa in addition to other crops like corn in southeastern Minnesota. He's concerned about the long-term trends, too -- he pointed out last year's likely record warmth -- and said he noticed the lack of snow cover in his region then, too.

""We were so dry going into last spring and we were in the field almost a month before we normally do. I would say that concern exists this year as well,"" Larsen said.

Gary Prescher, who has been farming a small grain operation for about 50 years in south-central Minnesota, said he's noticed more variability over the past six to 10 years. That's changing his long-term philosophy on the farm. He said he wants to make sure his operation can handle more extreme weather events, and that excess heat, cold, dryness, wetness or wind have ""forced some changes out here for me and my neighbors.""

""If you're just looking at averages, it's very deceiving,"" he said. ""It's either all or none.""

Make country's groundwater sustainable,"By scaling up efforts, states can safeguard resources, enhance agri-productivity.

India is an agricultural powerhouse and dominates the production of essential food grains such as rice, wheat, and pulses. This also places India at the forefront of producing water-intensive crops. In particular, paddy production in India caters to domestic demand and serves as a significant export commodity. However, the country's agriculture sector is thriving at the cost of its finitely extractable groundwater resources that are used for irrigation.

Between 2016 and 2024, the global population increased from 7.56 billion to 8.2 billion, and India's population increased from 1.29 billion to 1.45 billion. Meanwhile, according to the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) Report on Groundwater Assessment, the groundwater used for irrigation increased from 38% in 2016-17 to 52% in 2023-24. The situation is expected to intensify further in the coming years.

As a result of the current farming practices and the increasing population, most districts of the top paddy-producing states such as Rajasthan (19), Punjab (19), and Haryana (14) have over-exploited their groundwater for irrigation purposes. This has numerous repercussions such as the over-exploitation of groundwater, its salinisation, and the concentration of pollutants that adversely impact the quantity and quality of extractable groundwater. Notably, most districts in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan over-extract their groundwater for irrigation purposes. In addition to this, excessive use of fertilisers, especially for paddy cultivation, deteriorates the groundwater quality.

First, over-fertilisation results in increased soil salinity, which can leach into the groundwater. Rainfall is the main source of recharging groundwater and between Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana, Rajasthan received the highest average rainfall (608 mm) in 2023-24. Yet, its groundwater experienced the highest salinisation at 22%. This can be attributed to the fact that Rajasthan has an arid and semi-arid climate, and thus experiences a higher evaporation rate, causing higher groundwater salinity. Meanwhile, Punjab and Haryana experienced lower groundwater salinity at 2.77% and 0% respectively. This is due to their extensive canal irrigation network and adoption of micro-irrigation that avoids waterlogging and reduces their reliance on groundwater compared to Rajasthan.

Moreover, fertilisers can seep under the ground, resulting in the concentration of chemicals and metals like nitrates and uranium in the groundwater, beyond their permissible limits. For instance, nitrate contamination caused by run-off of nitrogen-based fertilisers in the groundwater is a key concern in paddy-producing states such as Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. Similarly, phosphate fertilisers used in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu seep into the groundwater and cause uranium contamination. Such issues adversely impact the health of the crop and population. The groundwater becomes unfit for consumption, heightening the risk of chronic illnesses such as blue baby syndrome in infants, thyroid disorders, dental fluorosis, and cancer. Polluted groundwater also leads to lower soil health and crop yield, further reducing agricultural productivity and income. The CGWB thus cautions that if the current farming and irrigation practices continue, more than half of the districts of Punjab will potentially have no groundwater available for future use. The same scenario could be experienced in 21-23% of the districts in Haryana and Rajasthan.

Considering the prevailing issues concerning sustainable groundwater management for irrigation, India must urgently take steps to secure its agricultural future. Projections of the world population touching 8.95 billion by 2036, out of which India's population is expected to hit 1.52 billion, underline the need to improve India's irrigation and farming practices. This is necessary to ensure water security and agricultural sustainability in the country. The government of India has already taken a few steps in the right direction. It introduced the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture in 2014 to promote sustainable agricultural practices like zero tillage, cover cropping, and micro-irrigation for prudent management of water resources, chemical usage, and improvement in soil health. It also announced the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana in 2015 to promote drip and sprinkler irrigation for reaping ""more crop per drop"". Likewise, the Atal Bhujal Yojana announced in 2019 encourages efficient irrigation methods for judicious groundwater management specifically in Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. According to the CGWB, 23% of the districts in the country had unsustainable groundwater levels in 2016-17, which reduced to 19% in 2023-24. This improvement can be attributed to the effectiveness of ongoing central government initiatives.

Furthermore, as agriculture is a state subject, the state governments should ramp up their efforts to address groundwater mismanagement in agriculture in a time-bound manner. Governments of states that have unsustainable groundwater levels should proactively take measures to remedy the situation. Moreover, states such as Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, and Odisha that have safe groundwater levels could be encouraged to practise resource-efficient agriculture for water-guzzling crops. Some states have already taken cognisance of this. For instance, Odisha's Integrated Irrigation Project for Climate Resilient Agriculture emphasises irrigation efficiency and climate-smart agricultural practices in the state that has already extracted about 48% of its groundwater. The project is funded through World Bank assistance at a 70:30 (Centre:state) cost-sharing basis. Such initiatives can serve as a blueprint for sustainable water management in agriculture, offering the dual benefit of preserving India's critical groundwater reserves while ensuring long-term agricultural resilience. By scaling up these efforts, especially across the water-stressed districts, states can safeguard their water resources, enhance agricultural productivity, and bolster their contribution to global food security in an era of mounting climate challenges.

The writer is chair, Institute for Competitiveness.",2025-01-09,by scaling up efforts states can safeguard resources enhance agriproductivity india is an agricultural powerhouse and dominates the production of essential food grains such as rice wheat and pulses this also places india at the forefront of producing waterintensive crops in particular paddy production in india caters to domestic demand and serves as a significant export commodity however the countrys agriculture sector is thriving at the cost of its finitely extractable groundwater resources that are used for irrigation between 2016 and 2024 the global population increased from 756 billion to 82 billion and indias population increased from 129 billion to 145 billion meanwhile according to the central groundwater board cgwb report on groundwater assessment the groundwater used for irrigation increased from 38 in 201617 to 52 in 202324 the situation is expected to intensify further in the coming years as a result of the current farming practices and the increasing population most districts of the top paddyproducing states such as rajasthan 19 punjab 19 and haryana 14 have overexploited their groundwater for irrigation purposes this has numerous repercussions such as the overexploitation of groundwater its salinisation and the concentration of pollutants that adversely impact the quantity and quality of extractable groundwater notably most districts in punjab haryana and rajasthan overextract their groundwater for irrigation purposes in addition to this excessive use of fertilisers especially for paddy cultivation deteriorates the groundwater quality first overfertilisation results in increased soil salinity which can leach into the groundwater rainfall is the main source of recharging groundwater and between rajasthan punjab and haryana rajasthan received the highest average rainfall 608 mm in 202324 yet its groundwater experienced the highest salinisation at 22 this can be attributed to the fact that rajasthan has an arid and semiarid climate and thus experiences a higher evaporation rate causing higher groundwater salinity meanwhile punjab and haryana experienced lower groundwater salinity at 277 and 0 respectively this is due to their extensive canal irrigation network and adoption of microirrigation that avoids waterlogging and reduces their reliance on groundwater compared to rajasthan moreover fertilisers can seep under the ground resulting in the concentration of chemicals and metals like nitrates and uranium in the groundwater beyond their permissible limits for instance nitrate contamination caused by runoff of nitrogenbased fertilisers in the groundwater is a key concern in paddyproducing states such as maharashtra telangana andhra pradesh and tamil nadu similarly phosphate fertilisers used in rajasthan punjab haryana uttar pradesh and tamil nadu seep into the groundwater and cause uranium contamination such issues adversely impact the health of the crop and population the groundwater becomes unfit for consumption heightening the risk of chronic illnesses such as blue baby syndrome in infants thyroid disorders dental fluorosis and cancer polluted groundwater also leads to lower soil health and crop yield further reducing agricultural productivity and income the cgwb thus cautions that if the current farming and irrigation practices continue more than half of the districts of punjab will potentially have no groundwater available for future use the same scenario could be experienced in 2123 of the districts in haryana and rajasthan considering the prevailing issues concerning sustainable groundwater management for irrigation india must urgently take steps to secure its agricultural future projections of the world population touching 895 billion by 2036 out of which indias population is expected to hit 152 billion underline the need to improve indias irrigation and farming practices this is necessary to ensure water security and agricultural sustainability in the country the government of india has already taken a few steps in the right direction it introduced the national mission for sustainable agriculture in 2014 to promote sustainable agricultural practices like zero tillage cover cropping and microirrigation for prudent management of water resources chemical usage and improvement in soil health it also announced the pradhan mantri krishi sinchai yojana in 2015 to promote drip and sprinkler irrigation for reaping more crop per drop likewise the atal bhujal yojana announced in 2019 encourages efficient irrigation methods for judicious groundwater management specifically in gujarat haryana karnataka madhya pradesh maharashtra rajasthan and uttar pradesh according to the cgwb 23 of the districts in the country had unsustainable groundwater levels in 201617 which reduced to 19 in 202324 this improvement can be attributed to the effectiveness of ongoing central government initiatives furthermore as agriculture is a state subject the state governments should ramp up their efforts to address groundwater mismanagement in agriculture in a timebound manner governments of

More opportunity for double crop soybeans | Farmtario,"Soybeans planted after overwintering crops can work - but growers have to remember July-sown beans only have half the growing season to work with. Performance expectations have to be realistic as a consequence.

This was one overarching conclusion of a South West Agricultural Conference panel discussion between Horst Bohner, soybean specialist with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Agribusiness, Watford-area grain farmer Roger Buurma, and Embro-area grain and livestock farmer Ian Matheson.

Matheson led the conversation by describing how his family's approach to double-crop soybeans has shifted over the last 20 years.

Why it matters: Adding an extra revenue source to a plot of land can help increase the profitability of that land.

He says early on they tried to push maturity and heat units, but due to the shortness of the growing season, moisture levels when the crop had to be harvested were very high. At times, Matheson says they had to push beans out of the wagon ""with a hockey stick."" Now, they opt for the shortest beans they can get, generally aiming for a mid-October harvest with moisture levels around 14 per cent.

At planting, usually after winter barley, Matheson says they opt for populations of 300,000 per acre to fill rows faster and maximize solar energy capture. Concerns about moisture mean they also ""plant these suckers deep,"" at 3.5 inches, never planting shallow unless there is a significant rain in the immediate forecast. They do not find emergence to be an issue.

The decision to double-crop soybeans is planned for every year - rather than being a last-minute decision based on environmental conditions - the area planted covering what they can harvest in one day. While Mathesons adds they ""have had yields as low as zero,"" they have made money from double-crop soybeans 18 of the last 20 years. Average yields for the family in 2024 was a record 46 bushel per acre.

Buurma is comparatively new at double-crop soybeans, having tried them for the first time in 2024. He says the crop is a good addition in their current rotation system - winter wheat, corn, and identity preserved soybeans - and says they also plan on adding winter canola to further diversify. The slightly earlier harvest period for winter canola would have the added benefit of providing a little earlier planting opportunity for the recently introduced double-crop soybeans.

Like Matheson, Buurma says they planted populations of 300,000 seeds per acre across five farms. The soybean used was another identity preserved variety, with 2875 heat units. Spray applications to control volunteer wheat and grasses were employed across all five fields, with two of those fields receiving a secondary application to control broadleaf weeds. The average harvest across all five fields came to a 28.9 bushel.

Buurma says he considered yields of 20 bushels per acre or higher a success in 2024 - a benchmark he established after taking into consideration harvest timing, costs, and the price at which he was able to sell them for.

For Bohner, success in double-crop soybeans remains elusive in his more northerly Stratford-area research plots.

""The real question is can you finish them in the fall,"" says Bohner.

He later highlights how upward trending temperatures in recent years are significantly adding to the number of heat units across Ontario's main crop-producing regions. Average heat units in the London area are up an additional 525 over the last decade, for example, while in Kemptville and Ridgetown the additional average is 485 and 369. Province-wide, heat units are up 13 per cent on average since 2014. Such increases open more opportunities to effectively finish double-crop soybeans.

Bohner cautions, however, killing frost dates are still quite variable. ""The sobering point,"" he says, remains that, by mid-summer, double-crop soybeans only have half the growing season to work with.",2025-01-09,soybeans planted after overwintering crops can work but growers have to remember julysown beans only have half the growing season to work with performance expectations have to be realistic as a consequence this was one overarching conclusion of a south west agricultural conference panel discussion between horst bohner soybean specialist with the ontario ministry of agriculture food and agribusiness watfordarea grain farmer roger buurma and embroarea grain and livestock farmer ian matheson matheson led the conversation by describing how his familys approach to doublecrop soybeans has shifted over the last 20 years why it matters adding an extra revenue source to a plot of land can help increase the profitability of that land he says early on they tried to push maturity and heat units but due to the shortness of the growing season moisture levels when the crop had to be harvested were very high at times matheson says they had to push beans out of the wagon with a hockey stick now they opt for the shortest beans they can get generally aiming for a midoctober harvest with moisture levels around 14 per cent at planting usually after winter barley matheson says they opt for populations of 300000 per acre to fill rows faster and maximize solar energy capture concerns about moisture mean they also plant these suckers deep at 35 inches never planting shallow unless there is a significant rain in the immediate forecast they do not find emergence to be an issue the decision to doublecrop soybeans is planned for every year rather than being a lastminute decision based on environmental conditions the area planted covering what they can harvest in one day while mathesons adds they have had yields as low as zero they have made money from doublecrop soybeans 18 of the last 20 years average yields for the family in 2024 was a record 46 bushel per acre buurma is comparatively new at doublecrop soybeans having tried them for the first time in 2024 he says the crop is a good addition in their current rotation system winter wheat corn and identity preserved soybeans and says they also plan on adding winter canola to further diversify the slightly earlier harvest period for winter canola would have the added benefit of providing a little earlier planting opportunity for the recently introduced doublecrop soybeans like matheson buurma says they planted populations of 300000 seeds per acre across five farms the soybean used was another identity preserved variety with 2875 heat units spray applications to control volunteer wheat and grasses were employed across all five fields with two of those fields receiving a secondary application to control broadleaf weeds the average harvest across all five fields came to a 289 bushel buurma says he considered yields of 20 bushels per acre or higher a success in 2024 a benchmark he established after taking into consideration harvest timing costs and the price at which he was able to sell them for for bohner success in doublecrop soybeans remains elusive in his more northerly stratfordarea research plots the real question is can you finish them in the fall says bohner he later highlights how upward trending temperatures in recent years are significantly adding to the number of heat units across ontarios main cropproducing regions average heat units in the london area are up an additional 525 over the last decade for example while in kemptville and ridgetown the additional average is 485 and 369 provincewide heat units are up 13 per cent on average since 2014 such increases open more opportunities to effectively finish doublecrop soybeans bohner cautions however killing frost dates are still quite variable the sobering point he says remains that by midsummer doublecrop soybeans only have half the growing season to work with,climate,0
Ethiopia Maintains Championship through Dedicated Commitment to African Union's CAADP -- Agriculture Minister,"Addis Ababa January 10/2025 (ENA) -- Ethiopia has maintained its championship through dedicated commitment to the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), an Agenda 2063 continental initiative that aims to help African countries eliminate hunger and reduce poverty, the Minister of Agriculture said.

An Ethiopian delegation led by Minister of Agriculture, Girma Amente is taking part in the African Union's CAADP Special Summit, being held in Kampala, Uganda.

In his opening remarks, Minister Girma said that as Africa has embarked on the journey of the CAADP Strategy and Action Plan for 2026 to 2035, the minister stressed the need for recognizing the critical role that agriculture plays in the socio-economic fabric of the continent,

Agriculture is not merely a sector; it is the backbone of our economies, the source of livelihoods for millions, and a key driver of sustainable development, Girma elaborated.

""The CAADP framework has been instrumental in guiding our efforts to enhance agricultural productivity, improve food security, and promote sustainable practices.

However, as we look ahead, we must acknowledge the evolving challenges we face -- climate change, population growth, urbanization, and the ongoing impacts of global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions.""

Speaking on success stories Ethiopia has recorded, over the past years his country has cascaded the CAADP into the National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP).

According to him, the Ethiopian NAIP has focused on transforming the agricultural sector to achieve food and nutrition security, improve livelihoods, and foster economic growth, adding that the plan emphasizes the importance of increasing public investment in agriculture, which is crucial for achieving the CAADP target.

To this effect, the plan has significantly increased its agricultural budget allocation and has demonstrated its commitment by meeting the 6 percent annual growth target of CAADP.

Moreover, the implementation of the National Agricultural Investment Plan has contributed to consistent improvements in annual agricultural production, elevating both crop yields and overall food production and livestock production, and also performed better in addressing resilience targets of the CAADP.

""Ethiopia has furthermore maintained its championship through its dedicated commitment to AU's decision on CAADP values and principles, facilitating an enabling environment for AU's forums, as it has strategic position as African political capital and persistent engagement in the subsequent CAADP Biennial Reporting,"" Girma noted.

In implementing agricultural development, Ethiopia has been exemplary to Africa in some prioritized agricultural initiatives among which, the minister indicated that the wheat production enhancement initiative, increased total wheat production to 231 million quintal per year.

""The initiative has significantly enhanced Ethiopia's self-reliance in wheat production. This initiative does not only fully substitute wheat import, but also fortifies food and nutrition security, underscoring Ethiopia's resilience in addressing global agricultural challenges,"" he elaborated.

He further added the other exemplary initiative is the Green legacy, which has demonstrated a remarkable progress in environmental sustainability by planting over 40 billion trees over the last six years. This has contributed to combating climate change, enhancing biodiversity, and restoring degraded ecosystems.

For him, these efforts symbolize a harmonious balance between agricultural productivity and environmental stewardship.

He also mentioned the transformative Lemat Trufat (Bounty of the Basket) initiative which has improved the livestock sector production and productivity specially dairy, poultry, egg, honey, fish and meat production, which also boosted incomes in rural areas and strengthened food and nutrition security by diversifying agricultural outputs.",2025-01-09,addis ababa january 102025 ena ethiopia has maintained its championship through dedicated commitment to the comprehensive africa agriculture development program caadp an agenda 2063 continental initiative that aims to help african countries eliminate hunger and reduce poverty the minister of agriculture said an ethiopian delegation led by minister of agriculture girma amente is taking part in the african unions caadp special summit being held in kampala uganda in his opening remarks minister girma said that as africa has embarked on the journey of the caadp strategy and action plan for 2026 to 2035 the minister stressed the need for recognizing the critical role that agriculture plays in the socioeconomic fabric of the continent agriculture is not merely a sector it is the backbone of our economies the source of livelihoods for millions and a key driver of sustainable development girma elaborated the caadp framework has been instrumental in guiding our efforts to enhance agricultural productivity improve food security and promote sustainable practices however as we look ahead we must acknowledge the evolving challenges we face climate change population growth urbanization and the ongoing impacts of global crises such as the covid19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions speaking on success stories ethiopia has recorded over the past years his country has cascaded the caadp into the national agricultural investment plan naip according to him the ethiopian naip has focused on transforming the agricultural sector to achieve food and nutrition security improve livelihoods and foster economic growth adding that the plan emphasizes the importance of increasing public investment in agriculture which is crucial for achieving the caadp target to this effect the plan has significantly increased its agricultural budget allocation and has demonstrated its commitment by meeting the 6 percent annual growth target of caadp moreover the implementation of the national agricultural investment plan has contributed to consistent improvements in annual agricultural production elevating both crop yields and overall food production and livestock production and also performed better in addressing resilience targets of the caadp ethiopia has furthermore maintained its championship through its dedicated commitment to aus decision on caadp values and principles facilitating an enabling environment for aus forums as it has strategic position as african political capital and persistent engagement in the subsequent caadp biennial reporting girma noted in implementing agricultural development ethiopia has been exemplary to africa in some prioritized agricultural initiatives among which the minister indicated that the wheat production enhancement initiative increased total wheat production to 231 million quintal per year the initiative has significantly enhanced ethiopias selfreliance in wheat production this initiative does not only fully substitute wheat import but also fortifies food and nutrition security underscoring ethiopias resilience in addressing global agricultural challenges he elaborated he further added the other exemplary initiative is the green legacy which has demonstrated a remarkable progress in environmental sustainability by planting over 40 billion trees over the last six years this has contributed to combating climate change enhancing biodiversity and restoring degraded ecosystems for him these efforts symbolize a harmonious balance between agricultural productivity and environmental stewardship he also mentioned the transformative lemat trufat bounty of the basket initiative which has improved the livestock sector production and productivity specially dairy poultry egg honey fish and meat production which also boosted incomes in rural areas and strengthened food and nutrition security by diversifying agricultural outputs,climate,0

"Chicago soybeans dip on stronger dollar, easing Argentina concerns","Chicago soybean futures slipped on Thursday, pressured by a stronger U.S. dollar and easing concerns over dryness in key exporter Argentina, while investors looked for more clarity on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans.

Corn rose as traders repositioned ahead of a U.S. Department of Agriculture crop report on Friday.

The most-active soybean contract ZS1! on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was down 0.7% at $9.8 a bushel as of 1155 GMT, while corn ZC1! was up 0.1% to $4.54-1/2 a bushel.

The market will close early on Thursday to honour the passing of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.

The U.S. dollar charged ahead on rising bond yields, following a report that Trump was considering the use of emergency measures to allow for a new tariff programme.

A stronger dollar makes U.S. grains more expensive for buyers holding other currencies, thus less competitive overseas.

Traders were awaiting the U.S. crop data for supply and demand insights.

Agricultural consultant Andrew Whitelaw of Episode 3 in Canberra noted that while the USDA report could prompt some market repositioning, ""a tight, range-bound market"" was expected.

Market players were also monitoring weather developments in key South American growing regions, with rain forecasts for Argentina in mid-January dispelling dryness worries.

In Brazil, dry weather is limiting soybean development in the southernmost state, while heavy rains may disrupt early harvests in central regions, according to meteorologists.

Despite this, Brazil is anticipating a bumper soybean harvest. StoneX forecast Brazil's soybean production to reach 171.4 million metric tons in 2024/25, a 14.4% increase from the previous season.

""Argentina is dry, but unless major problems emerge in Brazil, the total South American crop is expected to be enough to keep global supplies elevated,"" Bergman Grains Research said in a note.

The most-active wheat contract ZW1! fell 0.3% to $5.34-1/2 a bushel.

Purchases from South Korean feedmakers lent support to the market, even as cheaper supplies from Argentina and the Black Sea region weighed on prices.

Traders expect CME, which dominates agricultural futures with benchmark grain and soy contracts, may steal trading volume for hard red spring wheat (MWE:) after its launch slated for early in the second quarter.

The owner of the Chicago Board of Trade already runs U.S. markets for two other types of wheat, soft red winter wheat and hard red winter wheat.

""Market participants will now be able to manage price risk across every major type of wheat on one exchange and all cleared in a single clearing house,"" said John Ricci, CME's global head of agricultural products.

Hard red spring wheat was historically traded at the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, or MGEX, which launched its signature contract in 1883 to trade the high-quality crop used to make bread and frozen dough products. It has the thinnest trading volume of the three U.S. wheat contracts.

Miami International Holdings last year renamed the Minneapolis market as MIAX Futures Exchange after buying MGEX in 2020.

MIAX plans to transition the trading and dissemination of market data for MGEX products from CME's Globex platform to a platform it is building on June 30, spokesman Andy Nybo said.

MIAX is developing its own platform so it can launch new products without asking CME to add them to Globex, he added.

""We can control our own destiny,"" Nybo said. Asked about CME's launch, he said competition is healthy in markets.

""We're in it to compete.""

MIAX said in September it entered a licensing agreement with Bloomberg Index Services and will list a number of equity index products.

But exiting Globex will cost it some wheat business.

Brian Hoops, president of broker Midwest Market Solutions, said he will shift to CME's product.

""Taking it off of Globex, I think, is going to eliminate a lot of the volume from someone like me who's doing brokerage work with clients that are growing spring wheat,"" Hoops said.

""It's kind of the end of the old Minneapolis Grain Exchange product.""

Commercial traders, such as flour mills and grain elevators, initially might favor the Miami exchange as the established marketplace, or use both trading platforms, said Frayne Olson, an agricultural economist with North Dakota State University. Ultimately, he said, speculative traders will determine which platform dominates.

""If you don't have the trading volumes, the liquidity to get into and out of positions, the contract is going to fail,"" Olson said. ""And that is driven by the speculator.""

ADB upgrades Pakistan's growth prospects to 3% in FY2025,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its recent publication, has revised upwards Pakistan's growth forecast to 3.0% during the fiscal year 2024-25, from 2.8% projected in September 2024.

According to the report, greater macroeconomic stability, following the approval of the new International Monetary Fund (IMF) program under the Extended Fund Facility in September will support recovery. The report says, industrial output growth is projected to accelerate with the suspension of import management measures, higher investor confidence, and easier access to foreign exchange.

A more accommodative monetary policy because of faster-than-expected easing of inflationary pressures should further support economic activity through rebounding private investment.

However, growth in agriculture is expected to weaken due to the heavy monsoon downpours during July-September 2024 and flood-like conditions in parts of the country. Wheat and cotton, two of Pakistan's five major crops, are projected to perform poorly in FY2025.

The Asian Development Outlook for December 2024 also revised growth for FY2024, upwards to 2.5%, in line with the updated official estimate.

In South Asia, the growth forecasts have been revised downward to 5.9% for 2024 and 6.3% for 2025. The lower forecast for 2024 is mainly due to India's lower-than-expected Quarter 2 growth, driven by dampened manufacturing sector performance and lagging government spending.

While growth forecasts for Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been upgraded due to their recovery from the macroeconomic challenges of 2022- 2023, downward revisions for Bangladesh and Maldives have further weighed on the 2024 outlook.

The latter two economies' growth forecasts are also revised downward for 2025 due to the lingering effects of the political unrest of July-August 2024 in Bangladesh and fiscal consolidation measures in Maldives. Some weakening of growth is also expected for 2025 in Nepal relative to earlier forecasts.

According to the report, the growth forecast for developing Asia is trimmed to 4.9% for 2024 and 4.8% for 2025. Most adjustments to 2024 growth projections for individual economies and sub-regions are based on recent data releases.

The downward revisions to East Asia and South Asia offset the stronger growth in the Caucasus and Central Asia and Southeast Asia, shaving 0.1 percentage points from growth in the region. For 2025, slower growth is expected in South Asia due to weaker domestic demand prospects. According to the report, developing Asia's growth remains solid, but the new US presidential administration promises consequential changes. Domestic demand remains strong in much of the region, and exports continue to support growth, although momentum has moderated.

The incoming Trump administration promises significant policy changes with implications for the region, as discussed in this report's Special Topic. Most of the impact will be felt beyond this ADO's forecast horizon, however.

While growth projections for 2024-2025 remain largely unchanged from September, downside risks persist and include faster and larger US policy shifts than currently envisioned, a worsening of geopolitical tensions, and an even weaker PRC property market.

Separately, The Federal Revenue (FBR) issued clarification on the new process of monitoring of transit, shipment Cargo.

The Certain sections of the national press have published news items on January 9, 2025, regarding FBR's new process of monitoring the transit cargo according to which satellite tracking has been replaced with human monitoring only, said a press release issued here on Thursday.

It has been reported in the press that the license of the only company having a satellite tracking system has been revoked abruptly and the same has been awarded to four tracking companies which qualified technically four years ago.

Riordan Grain Services has announced it has signed a four-year lease agreement with GeelongPort for the use of a 3000 sqm shed on Corio Quay North in a move to boost the company's grain exporting efficiency.

Over the past five years Riordan has worked with GeelongPort to build an export program for wheat, barley and canola to a variety of international markets including New Zealand, Japan, South America, the Philippines and other destinations in south-east Asia.

After starting in 1996 with one tipper truck to transport grain and fertiliser to local customers, Riordan has expanded to now offer fully integrated accumulation, transport, storage, bulk commodity handling and packing services.

Since their first shipment in 2018 using the pioneering mobile bulk loading system, it has built up an annual export program of close to one million tonnes of grain in 2024.

""We have experienced growth in our business for more than 25 years, and this agreement with GeelongPort means we can be more confident in making plans,"" Riordan Managing Director Jim Riordan says.

""This is a significant addition to our business that will also support jobs in Geelong and provide Victorian grain growers more choices for grain marketing.""

GeelongPort's location means it can provide easy access to logistics routes for Geelong and south-west Victoria's supply chains.

GeelongPort CEO Brett Winter expressed his pride at the continued partnership between the port and one of the region's most prominent family-owned local businesses in Riordan Grain Services.

""The benefits of Riordan's operations on the state and economy are far reaching, particularly in regional communities throughout Victoira, and GeelongPort is proud to be an important link in this incredible supply chain,"" Winter says.

""By working together in a collaborative way, Riordan and GeelongPort have tackled a competitive market with an innovative and different approach to exporting grain.""

Looking back at retired Girl Scout cookies through the years,"WNBA partners with Arizona Girl Scouts to assemble 1,000 life-skill boxes for youth.

On Tuesday, the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) announced the start of the 2025 season, which typically runs through the spring. The organization also revealed two popular cookie flavors will be discontinued after the season.

Both Toast-Yay! and Girl Scout S'mores will be retired for the 2026 cookie season, joining Raspberry Rally, another cookie discontinued in 2023, which was a year after its debut.

The S'mores flavor combines graham sandwich cookies with a chocolate and marshmallow filling, while Toast-Yay! is a French toast-flavored treat dipped in icing.

Here's a list of some of the Girl Scout cookie flavors that have been discontinued over the years. Do you remember any?

Each year, the two bakeries must offer the same three cookies every season: Thin Mints, Trefoils and a peanut butter sandwich cookie, KayAnn Rutter, director of marketing and communications of Girl Scouts of Western Ohio, told The Enquirer.

JI announces countrywide protests over rising electricity prices,"Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) has announced plans for a nationwide protest on January 17, demanding a reduction in electricity prices.

The announcement was made by party chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman during a press conference in Lahore.

Hafiz Naeem criticised the government for not addressing the rising economic challenges, particularly the failure to reduce electricity bills despite the shutdown of Independent Power Producers (IPPs).

""Even though the IPPs are closed, electricity bills have not decreased,"" he said, emphasising the party's concerns regarding the economic hardships faced by the public.

He also pointed to the increasing prices of petrol and essential food items, which have continued to rise while other sectors, such as the stock exchange, show positive trends.

Highlighting the issue of IPPs, Hafiz Naeem stressed that despite the government's claims of resolving the crisis, the people continue to suffer.

""We raised the issue of IPPs, but they remain unaffected, and the promised relief has not materialised,"" he added. He also questioned the government's decision to exempt IPPs from income taxes while ordinary citizens continue to bear the tax burden.

The JI leader criticised the government for its handling of the agricultural sector, particularly the pricing of sugarcane and wheat, which are facing significant production losses due to unregulated pricing.

He urged the government to implement support programmes for these crops to avoid further losses in the agricultural sector.

Hafiz Naeem also expressed concerns about the education system, noting that the burden of educational expenses is shifting from the government to the private sector. ""The cost of education is rising, and the government is stepping away from its responsibility,"" he stated, adding that this could further deepen socio-economic inequalities.

On a political note, Hafiz Naeem called for an end to military interference in politics, criticising both the ruling parties and opposition for their ties with the military establishment. He also mentioned Karachi's situation, where political instability has been exacerbated by the establishment's influence.

Addressing international issues, Hafiz Naeem strongly condemned Israel's actions in Palestine, accusing the country of committing genocide with the support of the United States. He also highlighted the security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, advocating for peace talks with Afghanistan to ease the regional instability.

Hafiz Naeem concluded by urging the government to prioritise national unity and address the pressing issues of economic collapse, political instability, and international relations.",2025-01-09,jamaateislami ji has announced plans for a nationwide protest on january 17 demanding a reduction in electricity prices the announcement was made by party chief hafiz naeem ur rehman during a press conference in lahore hafiz naeem criticised the government for not addressing the rising economic challenges particularly the failure to reduce electricity bills despite the shutdown of independent power producers ipps even though the ipps are closed electricity bills have not decreased he said emphasising the partys concerns regarding the economic hardships faced by the public he also pointed to the increasing prices of petrol and essential food items which have continued to rise while other sectors such as the stock exchange show positive trends highlighting the issue of ipps hafiz naeem stressed that despite the governments claims of resolving the crisis the people continue to suffer we raised the issue of ipps but they remain unaffected and the promised relief has not materialised he added he also questioned the governments decision to exempt ipps from income taxes while ordinary citizens continue to bear the tax burden the ji leader criticised the government for its handling of the agricultural sector particularly the pricing of sugarcane and wheat which are facing significant production losses due to unregulated pricing he urged the government to implement support programmes for these crops to avoid further losses in the agricultural sector hafiz naeem also expressed concerns about the education system noting that the burden of educational expenses is shifting from the government to the private sector the cost of education is rising and the government is stepping away from its responsibility he stated adding that this could further deepen socioeconomic inequalities on a political note hafiz naeem called for an end to military interference in politics criticising both the ruling parties and opposition for their ties with the military establishment he also mentioned karachis situation where political instability has been exacerbated by the establishments influence addressing international issues hafiz naeem strongly condemned israels actions in palestine accusing the country of committing genocide with the support of the united states he also highlighted the security situation in khyber pakhtunkhwa advocating for peace talks with afghanistan to ease the regional instability hafiz naeem concluded by urging the government to prioritise national unity and address the pressing issues of economic collapse political instability and international relations,climate,0
What this week's winter wallop means for farmers across the U.S.,"Frigid air and bone-chilling winds from winter weather can lead to health risks such as frostbite and hypothermia. AccuWeather's Ali Reid shares some tips on how you can combat freezing temperatures.

A nasty dose of winter weather has pummeled much of the U.S. from Kansas to the East Coast, leaving many Americans to dig out of the blizzard -- including farmers. More is on the way, with the polar air expected to continue to grip some places until at least Friday.

Farmers always watch the weather, but depending on where they're located and what they produce, winter always presents mental challenges for growers, said Carolyn Olson, an organic farmer in southwestern Minnesota who is also vice president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors.

Producers know the timing and amount of winter moisture affect farming conditions for the rest of the year. It's also a time for planning ahead -- something becoming increasingly difficult as climate change ramps up variability in snowfall, rainfall and other weather conditions that can make or break an operation.

""They're doing that stressful part of making those decisions on how they're going to farm this year, what they're going to grow,"" Olson said. ""It's just a lot of pressure on agriculture at this time of the year.""

A generational storm

Biting wind and big drifts from almost a whole year's average snowfall in a single storm are hitting farmers in some parts of Kansas ""in ways that we haven't seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a lifetime,"" said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State University who developed an animal comfort tool.

It includes an index of heat and cold that a farmer can use -- along with their knowledge of their animals' age, coat, overall health and so forth -- to watch for situations when they may need to get animals out of dangerous areas.

The risk is real: Calves, especially, can die when temperatures slip below zero. So much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from reaching herds with food and water, Redmond said.

That means preparing by moving animals and having a plan to care for them ahead of time is key -- which is harder due to the unpredictability of climate change. Not having the right experience or infrastructure to prepare is ""really, really stressful on producers,"" Redmond said.

Reprieve for some areas

The storm missed some states further north like Iowa and Minnesota that are generally more accustomed to snow. Stu Swanson, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said that eases tasks like moving grain and working with livestock.

He added that without snow cover, the ground is more likely to freeze and thaw in a way that could benefit soils. Two years of drought followed by torrential rains last spring created tire ruts and compaction from farm machinery in some places, he said. He hopes that without as much snow, the freeze-thaw cycle will loosen up the soil and farmers may get the added bonus of some pests dying off before the spring.

""We don't have any growing crop now, so really temperature doesn't matter. We look forward to a good freeze,"" Swanson said.

Extremes and unpredictability

The lack of snow is a greater concern farther north in some parts of Minnesota, where producers do have winter crops like alfalfa or winter wheat.

Reliable snow cover is important in those areas because it insulates soil from cold. A few of inches of snow on top of a field can keep winter wheat's crown (which is still underground this time of year to withstand the winter) at 28 degrees Fahrenheit even if the air temperature is as low as minus 40, said Jochum Wiersma, an extension professor at the University of Minnesota.

""There's not a lot you can do, unfortunately,"" when ice breaks a plant's crown, said Martin Larsen, who grows alfalfa in addition to other crops like corn in southeastern Minnesota. He's concerned about the long-term trends, too -- he pointed out last year's likely record warmth -- and said he noticed the lack of snow cover in his region then, too.

""We were so dry going into last spring and we were in the field almost a month before we normally do. I would say that concern exists this year as well,"" Larsen said.

Gary Prescher, who has been farming a small grain operation for about 50 years in south-central Minnesota, said he's noticed more variability over the past six to 10 years. That's changing his long-term philosophy on the farm.

He said he wants to make sure his operation can handle more extreme weather events, and that excess heat, cold, dryness, wetness or wind have ""forced some changes out here for me and my neighbors.""

""If you're just looking at averages, it's very deceiving,"" he said. ""It's either all or none.""

Promoting trade through international trade missions - Ohio Ag Net | Ohio's Country Journal,"As part of its ongoing work to promote demand for corn and wheat grown by Ohio farmers, Ohio Corn & Wheat sent representatives on four international trade missions during 2024. These visits allowed Ohio Corn & Wheat representatives to advocate for growers and discuss the high quality and reliability of Ohio-grown grain. Throughout 2024, four Ohio Corn & Wheat grower leaders participated in missions spanning three continents.

Europe

In January, Ohio Corn Checkoff Secretary and Treasurer Patty Mann participated in a U.S.

Grains Council (USGC) trade mission to Malta, as part of the USGC's Corn Quality Rollout

Trade Mission, which is an annual event that showcases the quality and reliability of U.S. corn to international buyers. During this mission, council representatives, farmers, and trade experts presented findings from the Corn Harvest Quality Report and provided insights on crop quality, export readiness, and market conditions. The mission helped strengthen relationships with global partners, addressed specific buyer needs, and enhanced trust in U.S. grain exports. In addition, the initiative supported U.S. corn producers by expanding trade opportunities and promoted long-term partnerships across key markets.

Asia

Also in January, Ohio Corn Checkoff District 12 Representative Scott Haerr participated in a

USGC mission to Taiwan and Japan. While there, Scott and the U.S. delegation connected with buyers, and promoted the superior quality of U.S.-grown corn, and the positive impact it can have on those countries. Japan was the second largest importer of U.S.-grown corn in 2023, and the Taiwan market continues to provide new opportunities to American growers through DDGS (distillers dried grains with solubles), feed corn, and ethanol.

In September, Corn Checkoff District 7 Representative Randy Campbell visited Japan as part of a U.S. Meat Export Federation mission, which is an international outreach program aimed at expanding market access and boosting demand for U.S. beef, pork, and lamb. During this mission, USMEF representatives and farmers engaged with importers, retailers, distributors, and government officials to highlight the quality, safety, and versatility of U.S. meat products.

They provided market insights, addressed trade barriers, and built relationships to strengthen partnerships with key foreign markets. This mission and others like it support U.S. meat producers by promoting export growth, and can help secure a competitive edge in the global meat industry.

Africa

In March, Ohio Small Grains Checkoff District 4 Representative Bill Schroeder participated in a U.S. Wheat Associates mission to South Africa. The trade mission was an outreach initiative that focused on building and maintaining strong relationships with global wheat buyers and industry partners. Thanks to trade missions like this, U.S. Wheat Associates representatives and farmers can meet with international buyers, millers, and food processors to share insights on U.S. wheat quality, supply, and market trends.

While in South Africa, Bill and the delegation discussed specific customer needs, offered

technical assistance, and promoted the advantages of U.S. wheat in diverse food products. This mission played a key role in enhancing the reputation of U.S. wheat, and expanded export opportunities for American wheat producers across South Africa and around the globe.

Beyond being actively involved in international trade missions, Ohio Corn & Wheat hosted

export trade teams as well. International buyers were given a chance to tour ethanol production plants, meet Ohio growers, and see first-hand the farming practices of Ohio producers. In October, a U.S. Grains Council Export Exchange team from the Philippines and Thailand toured the state of Ohio, and made a stop at the Dayton-area farm of Ohio Corn Checkoff District 11 Representative Nathan Leis.",2025-01-09,as part of its ongoing work to promote demand for corn and wheat grown by ohio farmers ohio corn wheat sent representatives on four international trade missions during 2024 these visits allowed ohio corn wheat representatives to advocate for growers and discuss the high quality and reliability of ohiogrown grain throughout 2024 four ohio corn wheat grower leaders participated in missions spanning three continents europe in january ohio corn checkoff secretary and treasurer patty mann participated in a us grains council usgc trade mission to malta as part of the usgcs corn quality rollout trade mission which is an annual event that showcases the quality and reliability of us corn to international buyers during this mission council representatives farmers and trade experts presented findings from the corn harvest quality report and provided insights on crop quality export readiness and market conditions the mission helped strengthen relationships with global partners addressed specific buyer needs and enhanced trust in us grain exports in addition the initiative supported us corn producers by expanding trade opportunities and promoted longterm partnerships across key markets asia also in january ohio corn checkoff district 12 representative scott haerr participated in a usgc mission to taiwan and japan while there scott and the us delegation connected with buyers and promoted the superior quality of usgrown corn and the positive impact it can have on those countries japan was the second largest importer of usgrown corn in 2023 and the taiwan market continues to provide new opportunities to american growers through ddgs distillers dried grains with solubles feed corn and ethanol in september corn checkoff district 7 representative randy campbell visited japan as part of a us meat export federation mission which is an international outreach program aimed at expanding market access and boosting demand for us beef pork and lamb during this mission usmef representatives and farmers engaged with importers retailers distributors and government officials to highlight the quality safety and versatility of us meat products they provided market insights addressed trade barriers and built relationships to strengthen partnerships with key foreign markets this mission and others like it support us meat producers by promoting export growth and can help secure a competitive edge in the global meat industry africa in march ohio small grains checkoff district 4 representative bill schroeder participated in a us wheat associates mission to south africa the trade mission was an outreach initiative that focused on building and maintaining strong relationships with global wheat buyers and industry partners thanks to trade missions like this us wheat associates representatives and farmers can meet with international buyers millers and food processors to share insights on us wheat quality supply and market trends while in south africa bill and the delegation discussed specific customer needs offered technical assistance and promoted the advantages of us wheat in diverse food products this mission played a key role in enhancing the reputation of us wheat and expanded export opportunities for american wheat producers across south africa and around the globe beyond being actively involved in international trade missions ohio corn wheat hosted export trade teams as well international buyers were given a chance to tour ethanol production plants meet ohio growers and see firsthand the farming practices of ohio producers in october a us grains council export exchange team from the philippines and thailand toured the state of ohio and made a stop at the daytonarea farm of ohio corn checkoff district 11 representative nathan leis,climate,0

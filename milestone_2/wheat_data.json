And why are they expensive? Here's what to know about prices and supply","body":"Have you recently entered your local grocery store on the hunt for eggs, only to find they're noticeably more expensive - if you can find them at all?\n\nIt's not just your local shop. In fact, egg prices have increased nationwide by around 38% in the last year, bringing the average cost of one dozen up to $3.65 in November versus $3.37 in October and $2.14 in November 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index.\n\nRemember, $3.65 is just an average. According to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the wholesale price for a carton of large eggs on the New York market rose to $6.06 per dozen, while the Midwest region saw prices around $5.75 and California as high as $8.97, as of Jan. 3. In other cases, eggs simply are absent from shelves altogether.\n\nThe major reasons both experts and consumers are pointing to? The ongoing bird flu outbreak, the rising cost of doing business, and, in some locales, changing laws. When will things start to cool down? That may be a little harder to pinpoint.\n\nThe ongoing Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or bird flu, outbreak is the most obvious reason for the country's current egg dilemma. The highly contagious outbreak strain, H5N1, emerged among poultry flocks and wild birds in Europe in the fall of 2020 before moving over to the U.S., Africa, the Middle East and Asia, becoming the largest such outbreak in the U.S.\n\nThe USDA AMS said in a Jan. 3 report that grocery stores have seen \"record-high prices\" in retail markets across the nation, driven by \"significant outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial table egg layer flocks through December.\"\n\nAs of Jan. 6, the virus has affected more than 130 million poultry across 50 U.S. states since January 2022, according to the CDC. Because of the massive spread, infected birds are being culled across the U.S., with casualties sometimes numbering into the millions at a single location.\n\n\"Eggs are sold on markets as commodities, like corn and wheat, and wholesale prices for eggs are driven largely by supply and demand,\" Emily Metz, President & CEO of the American Egg Board, told USA TODAY. \"Our supply has been tight due to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza which is devastating to egg farmers. In the U.S. we've lost more than 40 million laying hens this year to bird flu.\"\n\nWith flocks being killed or deemed infected, the very source of eggs, a grocery staple, is currently under massive strain.\n\n\"The supply of laying hens is diminishing while demand for eggs remains the same,\" Dallas-based economist analyst Amy Nixon told USA TODAY. \"Unfortunately, cases of H5N1 have been increasing in recent weeks, which means supply will continue to be throttled and prices will rise more.\"\n\nFrom farm to fridge, getting fresh eggs to the consumer requires a lot of logistics. The cost of manufacturing and shipping products has increased all around, hitting the agricultural industry hard.\n\nWith the prices of everything from gas to feed on the upswing, so too is the price of getting eggs on shelves. Average U.S. gas prices sit around $3.069 per gallon, according to AAA, which is roughly in line with average prices from a year ago, but prices are still higher than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLabor is on the rise too, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Compensation costs for workers increased by 3.9% for the 12-month period ending in September 2024, part of an ongoing trend in labor prices that increased 4.6% for the 12-month period ending in September 2023.\n\nSome states, like California, are being hit especially hard by egg woes, and part of that is likely due to state-level legislation.\n\nCalifornia's Proposition 12, also called the Farm Animal Confinement Initiative, places restrictions on how hens, sows and veal calves can be kept.\n\nThe bill, which went into effect in recent years, in part banned confinement of egg-laying hens (chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) in certain areas with less than 1 square foot of usable floor space per hen.\n\nOther states including Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have similar laws that specifically provide animal welfare protections to egg-laying hens.\n\nThis limits how eggs can be produced and what can be sold in each state. Those that only allow cage-free products already face issues with fewer suppliers and farms (a little more than a third of U.S. egg layers are cage-free, per the USDA). Manufacturers and sellers are also facing a slowdown as they change operations in order to comply with these laws.\n\nThere are other factors that contribute to the issue as well. More Americans have been fiending for their daily egg breakfast in the past two decades, with per capita egg consumption increasing by 4.8% since 2000, according to United Egg Producers.\n\nFarmers have mostly kept pace, increasing hen productivity over those same years with improved health and disease prevention, nutrition, genetics, and flock management. However, this steadily high and increasing demand can pose a problem when even a small snafu occurs in the supply chain.\n\nEgg demand is also somewhat seasonal and peaks around the holidays, according to the USDA AMS, meaning a perfect storm of timing played a part in the current egg crisis.\n\n\"The volume of eggs sold at retail has been up year-over-year for 20 consecutive months and we're just coming out of the winter holidays when egg sales are highest due to holiday baking and entertaining,\" said Metz. \"These two forces [bird flu and seasonal demand] combined - tight supply and high demand - are directly causing the spike in wholesale prices we've seen recently. Although each retailer decides how much they're going to sell eggs for in the store, higher wholesale prices usually impact retail prices.\"\n\nSupply and prices will stabilize only when farms and producers can recover their stock of healthy, laying hens. USDA market forecast reports have recently reflected this by decreasing production predictions for the upcoming year.\n\n\"No one can predict the future, but bird flu remains an ongoing threat to our egg farms, and egg farmers are working around the clock to protect their birds, replenish supply and keep those eggs coming,\" said Metz. On a positive note, she said, farmers have a lot more experience fighting this disease now, meaning farms are able to recover faster.\n\nWith the outbreak still raging, however, it's unclear when that will happen. And, things may get worse before they get better.\n\n\"We may see a sudden spike in consumer demand, especially as fear spreads amongst consumers about future price increases and egg availability,\" said Nixon. \"Many local grocery stores are already trying to get ahead of this by limiting shopper purchase amounts to two dozen. As we saw during the COVID pandemic, fear spreads as rapidly as viruses, leading to bizarre consumer hoarding behaviors.\"\n\nShe also pointed out that the spread of this strain to cattle and other animals means we may soon see a constrained supply of meat and dairy products, leading to higher prices in those categories as well.\n\n\"Being that it's winter and the peak of flu season, this egg supply and price situation has the potential to get much worse in the next six weeks,\" Nixon said. \"In other words, it may be wise for all the health and fitness New Year's Resolutioners to start seeking alternate forms of protein. And that weekend omelet brunch with your friends? Expect higher prices soon for that too.\"","source":{"uri":"yahoo.com","dataType":"news","title":"Yahoo"},"authors":[],"image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_money_325/a1076fddf521b1dde7663d5c889be4aa","eventUri":"spa-3717483","sentiment":0.01960784313725483,"wgt":474114346,"relevance":15},{"uri":"8492491083","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"10:21:03","dateTime":"2025-01-09T10:21:03Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T10:19:29Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1270332-adb-upgrades-pakistans-growth-prospects-to-3-for-fy25","title":"ADB upgrades Pakistan's growth prospects to 3% for FY25","body":"ISLAMABAD: Amid the federal government's arduous efforts to improve the economy, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has revised Pakistan's growth forecast to 3% during the fiscal year 2024-25 as from the previously projected 2.8% in September 2024.\n\nThe report says that greater macroeconomic stability, following the approval of the new International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme under the Extended Fund Facility, will support economic recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, it projects industrial output growth to accelerate with the suspension of import management measures, higher investor confidence, and easier access to foreign exchange.\n\nIt further says industrial output growth is projected to accelerate with the suspension of import management measures, higher investor confidence, and easier access to foreign exchange.\n\nA more accommodating monetary policy because of faster-than-expected easing of inflationary pressures should further support economic activity through rebounding private investment.\n\nHowever, growth in agriculture is expected to weaken due to the heavy monsoon downpours during July-September 2024 and flood-like conditions in parts of the country.\n\nWheat and cotton, two of the country's five major crops, are projected to perform poorly in FY25.\n\nThe Asian Development Outlook (ADO) for December 2024 also revised growth for FY2024, upwards to 2.5%, in line with the updated official estimate.\n\nIn South Asia, the growth forecasts have been revised downward to 5.9% for 2024 and 6.3% for 2025. The lower forecast for 2024 is mainly due to India's lower-than-expected second-quarter growth, driven by dampened manufacturing sector performance and lagging government spending.\n\nWhile growth forecasts for Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been upgraded due to their recovery from the macroeconomic challenges of 2022- 2023, downward revisions for Bangladesh and Maldives have further weighed on the 2024 outlook.\n\nThe latter two economies' growth forecasts are also revised downward for 2025 due to the lingering effects of the political unrest of July-August 2024 in Bangladesh and fiscal consolidation measures in Maldives.\n\nSome weakening of growth is also expected for 2025 in Nepal relative to earlier forecasts.\n\nThe growth forecast, adds the report, for developing Asia is trimmed to 4.9% for 2024 and 4.8% for 2025. Most adjustments to 2024 growth projections for individual economies and sub-regions are based on recent data releases.\n\nThe downward revisions to East Asia and South Asia offset the stronger growth in the Caucasus, Central Asia and Southeast Asia, shaving 0.1% from growth in the region.\n\nFor 2025, slower growth is expected in South Asia due to weaker domestic demand prospects. Meanwhile, developing Asia's growth remains solid, but the new United States administration promises consequential changes.\n\nDomestic demand remains strong in much of the region, and exports continue to support growth, although momentum has moderated.\n\nThe incoming Trump administration promises significant policy changes with implications for the region, as discussed in this report's Special Topic.\n\nMost of the impact will be felt beyond this ADO's forecast horizon, however, while growth projections for 2024-2025 remain largely unchanged from September, downside risks persist and include faster and larger US policy shifts than currently envisioned, a worsening of geopolitical tensions, and an even weaker PRC property market.","source":{"uri":"thenews.com.pk","dataType":"news","title":"The News International"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2025-01-09/l_1270332_025523_updates.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.4666666666666666,"wgt":474114063,"relevance":18},{"uri":"b-8492491540","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"10:20:20","dateTime":"2025-01-09T10:20:20Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T10:19:46Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://alonsovidal.com/article/10-health-benefits-of-spirulina-algae-living/10486","title":"10 Health Benefits of Spirulina - Algae Living (2025)","body":"Table of Contents 1.

A single tablespoon (7 grams) of dried spirulina powder contains (2 Trusted Source):\n\nIn addition, the same amount holds only 20 calories and 1.7 grams of digestible carbs.\n\nGram for gram, spirulina may be the singlemost nutritious foodon the planet.\n\nA tablespoon (7 grams) of spirulina provides a small amount of fat -- around 1 gram -- including bothomega-6 and omega-3 fatty acidsin an approximately 1.5-1.0 ratio.\n\nThe quality of the protein in spirulina is considered excellent -- comparable to eggs. It gives all the essential amino acids that you need.\n\nIt is often claimed that spirulina contains vitamin B12, but this is false. It has pseudovitamin B12, which has not been shown to be effective in humans (3 Trusted Source,4 Trusted Source).\n\nSUMMARY Spirulina is a type of blue-green algae that grows in both salt and fresh water. It may be one of the most nutrient-dense foods on earth.\n\nOxidative damage can harm your DNA and cells.\n\nThis damage can drive chronic inflammation, which contributes to cancer and other diseases (5).\n\nSpirulina is a fantastic source of antioxidants, which can protect against oxidative damage.\n\nIts main active component is called phycocyanin. This antioxidant substance also gives spirulina its unique blue-green color.\n\nPhycocyanin can fight free radicals and inhibit production of inflammatory signaling molecules, providing impressive antioxidant andanti-inflammatoryeffects (6 Trusted Source,7 Trusted Source,8 Trusted Source).\n\nSUMMARY Phycocyanin is the main active compound in spirulina. It has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nHeart disease is the world's leading cause of death.\n\nMany risk factors are linked to an increased risk of heart disease.\n\nAs it turns out, spirulina positively impacts many of these factors. For example, it can lower total cholesterol, \"bad\" LDL cholesterol andtriglycerides, while raising \"good\" HDL cholesterol.\n\nIn a study in 25 people with type 2 diabetes, 2 grams of spirulina per day significantly improved these markers (9Trusted Source).\n\nAnother study in people with high cholesterol determined that 1 gram of spirulina per day lowered triglycerides by 16.3% and \"bad\" LDL by 10.1% (10Trusted Source).\n\nSeveral other studies have found favorable effects -- though with higher doses of 4.5-8 grams per day (11Trusted Source,12Trusted Source).\n\nSUMMARY Studies indicate that spirulina can lower triglycerides and \"bad\" LDL cholesterol and may simultaneously raise \"good\" HDL cholesterol.\n\nFatty structures in your body are susceptible to oxidative damage.\n\nThis is known as lipid peroxidation, a key driver of many serious diseases (13Trusted Source,14Trusted Source).\n\nFor example, one of the key steps in the development of heart disease is the oxidation of \"bad\" LDL cholesterol (15Trusted Source).\n\nInterestingly, theantioxidantsin spirulina appear to be particularly effective at reducing lipid peroxidation in both humans and animals (16Trusted Source,17Trusted Source).\n\nIn a study in 37 people with type 2 diabetes, 8 grams of spirulina per day significantly reduced markers of oxidative damage. It also increased levels of antioxidant enzymes in the blood (18Trusted Source).\n\nSUMMARY Fatty structures in your body can become oxidized, driving the progression of many diseases. The antioxidants in spirulina can help prevent this.\n\nSome evidence suggests that spirulina hasanti-cancer properties.\n\nResearch in animals indicates that it can reduce cancer occurrence and tumor size (19Trusted Source,20Trusted Source).\n\nSpirulina's effects on oral cancer -- or cancer of the mouth -- have been particularly well studied.\n\nOne study examined 87 people from India with precancerous lesions -- called oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) -- in the mouth.\n\nAmong those who took 1 gram of spirulina per day for one year, 45% saw their lesions disappear -- compared to only 7% in the control group (21Trusted Source).\n\nWhen these people stopped taking spirulina, almost half of them redeveloped lesions in the following year.\n\nIn another study of 40 individuals with OSMF lesions, 1 gram of spirulina per day led to greater improvement in OSMF symptoms than the drug Pentoxyfilline (22Trusted Source).\n\nSUMMARY Spirulina may have anti-cancer properties and appears especially effective against a type of precancerous lesion of the mouth called OSMF.\n\nHigh blood pressure is a main driver of many serious diseases, including heart attacks, strokes and chronic kidney disease.\n\nWhile 1 gram of spirulina is ineffective, a dose of 4.5 grams per day has been shown to reduce blood pressure in individuals with normal levels (10Trusted Source,11Trusted Source).\n\nThis reduction is thought to be driven by an increased production ofnitric oxide, a signaling molecule that helps your blood vessels relax and dilate (23Trusted Source).\n\nSUMMARY A higher dose of spirulina may lead to lower blood pressure levels, a major risk factor for many diseases.\n\nAllergic rhinitis is characterized by inflammation in your nasal passageways.\n\nIt is triggered by environmental allergens, such as pollen, animal hair or even wheat dust.\n\nSpirulina is a popular alternative treatment for symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and there is evidence that it can be effective (24 Trusted Source).\n\nIn one study in 127 people with allergic rhinitis, 2 grams per day dramatically reduced symptoms like nasal discharge, sneezing, nasal congestion and itching (25 Trusted Source).\n\nSUMMARY Spirulina supplements are very effective against allergic rhinitis, reducing various symptoms.\n\nThere are many different forms of anemia.\n\nThe most common one is characterized by a reduction in hemoglobin or red blood cells in your blood.\n\nAnemia is fairly common in older adults, leading to prolonged feelings of weakness andfatigue(26 Trusted Source).\n\nIn a study in 40 older people with a history of anemia, spirulina supplements increased the hemoglobin content of red blood cells and improved immune function (27 Trusted Source).\n\nKeep in mind that this is just one study. More research is needed before any recommendations can be made.\n\nSUMMARY One study suggests that spirulina can reduce anemia in older adults, though more research is needed.\n\nExercise-induced oxidative damage is a major contributor to muscle fatigue.\n\nCertain plant foods have antioxidant properties that can help athletes andphysically active individualsminimize this damage.\n\nSpirulina appears beneficial, as some studies pointed to improved muscle strength and endurance.\n\nIn two studies, spirulina enhanced endurance, significantly increasing the time it took for people to become fatigued (28 Trusted Source,29 Trusted Source).\n\nSUMMARY Spirulina may provide multiple exercise benefits, including enhanced endurance and increased muscle strength.\n\nThere is also some evidence that spirulina can be effective in humans.\n\nIn a two-month study in 25 people with type 2 diabetes, 2 grams of spirulina per day led to an impressive reduction in blood sugar levels (9Trusted Source).\n\nHbA1c, a marker for long-term blood sugar levels, decreased from 9% to 8%, which is substantial. Studies estimate that a 1% reduction in this marker can lower the risk of diabetes-related death by 21% (33 Trusted Source).\n\nHowever, this study was small and short in duration. More studies are necessary.\n\nSUMMARY Some evidence suggests that spirulina may benefit people with type 2 diabetes, significantly reducing fasting blood sugar levels.\n\nSpirulina is a type of cyanobacteria -- often referred to as blue-green algae -- that is incredibly healthy.\n\nIt may improve your levels of blood lipids, suppress oxidation, reduce blood pressure and lower blood sugar.\n\nWhile more research is needed before any strong claims can be made, spirulina may be one of the fewsuperfoodsworthy of the title.\n\nIf you want to give this supplement a try, it's widely available in stores andonline.","source":{"uri":"alonsovidal.com","dataType":"blog","title":"Alonsovidal"},"authors":[],"image":"https://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?q=10 Health Benefits of Spirulina - Algae Living (2025)","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.1529411764705881,"wgt":474114020,"relevance":5},{"uri":"b-8492491566","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"10:20:16","dateTime":"2025-01-09T10:20:16Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T10:19:46Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://ithelpsllc.com/article/10-nutrient-deficiencies-linked-to-celiac-disease/5741","title":"10 Nutrient Deficiencies Linked to Celiac Disease (2025)","body":"Celiac disease can pose a serious challenge for many people worldwide. This autoimmune disorder triggers damage to the small intestine when individuals consume gluten. Gluten exists in wheat, barley, and rye, so avoiding it can feel complicated. Yet, vigilance about gluten intake can stop immune system attacks and prevent further intestinal damage.\n\nHowever, celiac disease often goes beyond digestive discomfort. The small intestine loses its ability to absorb nutrients effectively, causing malabsorption. People can experience deficiencies in vitamins, minerals, and other vital components. Furthermore, certain gluten-free foods lack the added nutrients found in enriched wheat-based products. Thus, even when individuals follow a strict gluten-free plan, nutrient deficiencies can occur.\n\nThis blog post explores 10 key nutrient deficiencies linked to celiac disease. You will also learn about the blood tests that help detect these deficiencies. By understanding these nutrients, you can manage your health more effectively and work with healthcare professionals to maintain balanced nutrient levels.\n\nCeliac disease attacks the lining of the small intestine. When a person with celiac disease ingests gluten, the immune system treats it as a threat. This immune response damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections in the intestinal lining. Villi help absorb nutrients from food. When these structures are harmed, the body struggles to pull vitamins, minerals, and proteins from meals.\n\nOver time, repeated damage leads to persistent malabsorption. People might feel symptoms such as gas, bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. However, some individuals remain asymptomatic while suffering hidden nutrient deficiencies. This situation can develop into more severe health issues, including anemia, bone problems, and nervous system disorders.\n\nA gluten-free diet remains the main treatment. Nonetheless, removing gluten from your life does not guarantee perfect nutrient intake. Some gluten-free products are low in fortified vitamins and minerals. Additionally, cross-contamination in food preparation settings can still provoke intestinal damage.\n\nWhen gluten triggers an immune reaction, the small intestine endures constant inflammation. This inflammation can last for weeks if gluten slips into meals. The resulting swelling flattens and damages the villi. Without healthy villi, your body cannot absorb nutrients efficiently.\n\nMalabsorption leads to a variety of health issues. For instance, fatigue might stem from low iron or low B vitamins. Weak bones and muscles might suggest a lack of vitamin D or calcium. If left unaddressed, these deficiencies can worsen and create long-term complications.\n\nAdopting a gluten-free diet should reduce intestinal damage. Yet, gluten-free foods often lack iron, B vitamins, and fiber. Food manufacturers frequently fortify wheat-based foods, but they rarely fortify gluten-free options in the same manner. Therefore, people with celiac disease can develop deficiencies if they do not plan meals carefully.\n\nCeliac disease can result in several overlapping deficiencies. The following sections outline 10 nutrients and how their lack might affect the body. You will also find insight into how these nutrients work and the symptoms of deficiency.\n\nIron plays a vital role in forming hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood. It also helps create myoglobin, which transports oxygen in muscles. Moreover, iron supports growth, hormone production, and collagen synthesis.\n\nVitamin A supports immune function and vision. It helps cells grow and protects them from free-radical damage. In addition, vitamin A promotes bone, tooth, eye, and skin health.\n\nVitamin B1 helps turn food into energy. It also supports skin, hair, muscle, and brain health. Thiamine aids immune function and certain hormone production.\n\nVitamin B6 supports the body's enzyme reactions. It also aids in red blood cell production and brain function. This vitamin helps transform food into energy and boosts the immune system.\n\nBiotin controls how genes work and helps cells communicate. It also regulates blood sugar and promotes healthy hair, skin, and nails. Additionally, biotin supports metabolism by turning food into energy.\n\nVitamin B9 aids in building DNA. It also helps create red blood cells and supports cell growth. Folate is crucial during pregnancy to prevent birth defects and other complications.\n\nVitamin B12 assists in forming DNA and plays a role in nerve cell protection. It also helps make red blood cells and converts food into energy. Additionally, it influences mood and cognitive function.\n\nVitamin D controls calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood. It also impacts mood, immune health, and bone strength. Furthermore, it helps regulate blood pressure and blood sugar.\n\nVitamin E protects cells from oxidative damage and works alongside vitamin K in blood clotting. It also supports nerve, muscle, and eye health.\n\nVitamin K helps with blood clotting and wound healing. It supports bone density and keeps calcium levels in balance. Moreover, vitamin K can aid in heart health.\n\nIdentifying nutrient deficiencies is crucial. Blood tests can detect whether your body lacks these vital elements. Below, you will find the key blood tests for each nutrient. Healthcare providers often order these tests when celiac disease or its symptoms appear.\n\nProviders check iron markers if you feel tired, weak, or notice unusual heart rate. Chronic low iron might suggest ongoing malabsorption or blood loss from intestinal damage.\n\nLow vitamin A might occur if you have night blindness, persistent infections, or extremely dry skin and hair. Testing helps confirm whether celiac disease is contributing to a deficiency.\n\nDoctors may suggest this test if you experience mental fog, coordination issues, or persistent fatigue. Early detection can help you address potential complications.\n\nYou may need this test if you show signs of anemia, mouth soreness, or low immunity. Addressing a deficiency can help maintain healthy brain function and hormone production.\n\nHair loss, skin problems, and brittle nails often signal low biotin. Celiac disease can amplify these symptoms, making testing essential for proper management.\n\nWhen you suffer from unexplained weakness, headaches, or elevated homocysteine levels, your doctor might order folate tests. Chronic deficiency can lead to complications in cell growth.\n\nB12 tests can reveal if celiac disease causes persistent fatigue, nerve issues, or memory problems. Early detection helps prevent neurological damage.\n\nDoctors often suggest vitamin D testing if you have bone pain, muscle weakness, or depression. Maintaining adequate vitamin D can support healthy bones and immune function.\n\nYou may need this test if you notice coordination difficulties or muscle weakness. Children with celiac disease also benefit from early testing because vitamin E influences their growth and development.\n\nProviders may suggest these tests if you experience excessive bleeding, bruising, or suspect poor bone density. Correcting vitamin K deficiency helps protect bones and supports wound healing.\n\nMany labs combine these nutrient tests into a single panel. One example is the Ulta Lab Tests Celiac Disease Nutrient Deficiency Panel. It measures iron, vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin B6, vitamin B7, vitamin B9, vitamin B12, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K.\n\nThis single panel simplifies the testing process by providing a broad overview of your nutritional status. Your doctor can then interpret the results and recommend specific supplements or dietary changes. Such panels save time and reduce the need for multiple lab visits.\n\nA strict gluten-free diet remains the cornerstone of celiac disease management. This approach allows the small intestine to heal, which improves nutrient absorption. However, experts recommend reading labels thoroughly. Even a small amount of gluten can trigger an immune response.\n\nMany nutritionists suggest working with a registered dietitian. This professional can help develop a meal plan that replaces nutrient-depleted foods with healthier alternatives. Adding fortified gluten-free products may ensure an adequate intake of iron, B vitamins, and other key nutrients.\n\nMany doctors also prescribe supplements if blood test results indicate a severe deficiency. You might need iron pills, vitamin D capsules, or B12 injections. Always follow professional guidance regarding dosage and duration.\n\nCeliac disease often requires periodic lab tests. These check if healing has occurred and if nutrient deficiencies persist. Monitoring ensures that you stay on track and adjust your diet or supplements as needed.\n\nEven a tiny crumb of gluten can restart intestinal damage. Cross-contamination in shared kitchens and restaurants remains a big concern. You must use separate cutting boards, utensils, and toasters. Frequent slip-ups can lead to chronic inflammation and worsen deficiencies.\n\nCertain medical conditions can complicate celiac disease. For instance, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) might mask or mimic some symptoms. Other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes or thyroid disease, might also appear in celiac patients. Each additional condition can influence your body's ability to absorb nutrients.\n\nChronic stress can impact digestion and hormone balance. For example, high stress levels might reduce appetite or alter how your body handles food. Exercise habits, sleep patterns, and mental well-being also play essential roles in maintaining overall health.\n\nAvoid relying on one gluten-free grain, such as rice or corn, for every meal. Introduce grains like quinoa, buckwheat, or millet. This variety helps provide a broader spectrum of vitamins and minerals.\n\nFruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats offer more nutrients than highly processed options. Whole foods also supply fiber, which aids digestion. However, always check for potential gluten in sauces, marinades, and seasonings.\n\nSome gluten-free cereals, breads, and flours are fortified with B vitamins and iron. These products can help close nutrient gaps. Compare labels to find the best choices for your daily requirements.\n\nSnacks such as nuts, seeds, hard-boiled eggs, and yogurt provide protein, healthy fats, and vitamins. You can also enjoy fruit smoothies blended with spinach or kale for an extra nutrient boost.\n\nA registered dietitian or nutritionist with celiac expertise can tailor a meal plan for your needs. They can factor in food allergies or intolerances, ensuring your diet remains both safe and nutritious.\n\nSticking to a gluten-free diet can feel overwhelming at first. However, with time and practice, you can manage celiac disease effectively. Research suggests that once gluten is removed from the diet, the small intestine begins to heal. This healing improves nutrient absorption and reduces deficiency risks.\n\nStill, many celiac patients do not realize the importance of ongoing monitoring. Nutrient deficiencies can creep up slowly, so regular check-ups and blood tests remain essential. If you suspect any deficiency signs -- like extreme fatigue, hair loss, or frequent infections -- talk with your healthcare provider.\n\nBuilding a support system also matters. Family and friends can help you navigate social events with gluten-free options. Online communities or local celiac groups can offer recipe ideas and brand recommendations. Sharing experiences and strategies often reduces stress.\n\nBlood tests provide valuable insight into your nutritional status. Early detection of deficiencies helps prevent severe complications. Addressing anemia or low vitamin D, for instance, can avert bone problems or nerve damage down the line.\n\nHealthcare professionals typically combine blood test results with your medical history to form a comprehensive treatment plan. This plan might include short-term supplements and long-term dietary strategies. By following medical advice, you can restore proper nutrient levels and improve your overall well-being.\n\nCeliac disease does more than cause digestive distress -- it can rob your body of vital nutrients. The autoimmune reaction triggered by gluten damages the small intestine, leading to malabsorption. Over time, this process can create deficiencies in iron, vitamin A, the B vitamins, and the fat-soluble vitamins D, E, and K. These deficiencies may lead to anemia, bone pain, nerve damage, and persistent fatigue.\n\nFortunately, you can take control. A strict gluten-free diet reduces intestinal inflammation and helps restore nutrient absorption. Yet, gaps in fortification among gluten-free products make it difficult to meet daily requirements. Regular blood tests offer clarity on your status, detecting low nutrient levels before they spark serious health problems.\n\nWorking with healthcare providers and dietitians can optimize your intake of crucial vitamins and minerals. Meal planning that includes a variety of whole foods further improves nutrient diversity. Also, testing through panels like Ulta Lab Tests' Celiac Disease Nutrient Deficiency Panel provides a broad look at where you stand.\n\nBy staying informed and proactive, you can minimize the impact of celiac disease on your nutrient levels. Monitoring your health, following a balanced gluten-free diet, and seeking professional guidance all play vital roles. Over time, these steps help you maintain stronger energy, healthier bones, and an overall improved quality of life.","source":{"uri":"ithelpsllc.com","dataType":"blog","title":"Ithelpsllc"},"authors":[],"image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.ultalabtests.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/10-Nutrient-Deficiencies-Linked-to-challenges-of-iron-deficiency-linked-to-celiac-disease.jpg?fit=1080%2C1080&quality=100&ssl=1","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.1607843137254902,"wgt":474114016,"relevance":100},{"uri":"8492488007","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"10:19:23","dateTime":"2025-01-09T10:19:23Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T10:17:30Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/usa-todays-50-top-picks-100905545.html","title":"USA TODAY's 50 Top Picks for CES 2025","body":"What happens in Vegas doesn't stay in Vegas - especially when it comes to tech.\n\nThat is, you didn't need to attend the annual tech convention CES 2025 in Las Vegas to know about the hottest gadgets and gear coming down the road. You've got a summary in your hands right here.\n\nFrom wireless wearables and voice-controlled smart home gadgets to giant TVs and handheld projectors to autonomous cars and passenger drones, more than 140,000 attendees roamed nearly 2.5 million square feet of showroom floor space to play around with tomorrow's technology today.\n\nAs expected, artificial intelligence (AI) was one of the pervasive themes this year.\n\nFor our USA TODAY awards package, we wanted to find extraordinary products across several categories. Many of our picks were based on hands-on demos, even if they were prototypes. In other instances, we weren't able to test them (like a flying car or multipurpose yard robot), but conceptually they proved super innovative, unique, and something we could see ourselves using in the future.\n\nThe following is a look at USA TODAY's 50 top picks from the CES 2025.\n\nLG SIGNATURE OLED T\n\nWhile we got a sneak peak of this TV last year, LG Electronics officially unveiled its 77-inch LG SIGNATURE OLED T - the world's first transparent and true wireless 4K OLED TV - and announced a ship date of December 2024. When turned off, the television blends into your room décor, but when turned on you can choose from it to be opaque (like your current TV) or show animated images, such as fish in a virtual fish tank. Because its wireless, components (like a cable box or video game system) can be connected to the \"Zero Connect Box\" somewhere else in the room.\n\nWhile Samsung's \"stretchable\" TV concept wowed crowds at CES, it won't likely see the light of day. Instead, both the Samsung QN990F and QN900F are \"ultra-premium\" 8K TVs (7680 × 4320 pixels) that include Samsung's comprehensive \"Vision AI\" family of features, including smart upscaling - to take content that's presented in HD or 4K and deliver a near 8K quality picture. Ideal for night or dark environments, these Neo QLED televisions also support Samsung's Wireless One Connect Box, which can transmit up to 8K resolution (up to 120Hz refresh rate) and audio, wirelessly up to 33 feet away -- even with obstacles in its path. Other features include Wi-Fi 7 for superfast Tizen OS-powered Smart TV access and support for the Samsung Art Store to turn your TV -- when not watching TV shows, movies or sports - into a gallery-like experience in your home (now with works of art from The MoMA, Musée d'Orsay, The Met, and more).\n\nThe Valerion VisionMaster Max\n\nAfter raising nearly $11 million on Kickstarter - making it the most funded project of 2024 - startup Valerion debuted its flagship projector, VisionMaster Max, at CES 2025. Delivering a cinematic experience through advanced RGB laser technology and precision-engineered lens systems, this buzzworthy 4K projector offers a bright 3,000 ISO lumens picture, high 15,000:1 contrast ratio (for deep blacks), and supporting HDR10+, Dolby Vision and IMAX-enhanced certification. Dubbed a \"Home theater in a box,\" VisionMaster Max is capable of producing an image up to 300 inches!\n\nAurzen ZIP\n\nIf it's a portable projector you're after, ZIP from Aurzen is the world's first tri-fold portable projector. When folded, it looks like a clamshell \"flip phone\" that's about an inch high, but once the Z-shaped device is opened and propped on a surface, it projects a 720p high-definition and autofocused image onto a wall or ceiling, with 100 lumens of brightness, via its dual-hinge gimbal with 180-degree flexibility. Whether it's presentations in the boardroom or movies in the bedroom, project content from your phone (without needing Wi-Fi) or utilize the wireless HDMI dongle that plugs into a content source. Touch controls on the top let you turn on and tweak the picture. Integrated stereo speakers can simulate surround sound. Battery life tops 1.5 hours between charges.\n\nASUS Zenbook A14\n\nThere's a lot to love about the ASUS Zenbook A14, starting with its unbelievably long battery life of up to 32 hours between charges. Yes, you read that correctly. It's also billed as the lightest 14-inch Copilot+ PC laptop in the world at under 900 grams, thanks in part to its \"Ceraluminum\" material -- fusing ceramics with aerospace-grade aluminum - that's 30% lighter and three times stronger than traditional anodized aluminum. A \"phone link\" feature allows you to manage calls, notifications, and file transfers - directly from the laptop. Starting at $899, the Zenbook A14 is debuting in February.\n\nHP OmniStudio X\n\nDesigned for stationary content creators, HP's first next-gen AI all-in-one PC packs several tools to help creative professionals - thanks to its Intel Core Ultra 200V series processor, with up to 47 TOPS NPU (neuroprocessing unit) that's estimated to be as much as 244% faster response times when editing photos and videos. Plus, HP AI Companion uses generative AI to aid users, while the 5-megapixel infrared camera, with adaptive audio, boosts virtual meetings.\n\nAcer Aspire Vero 16\n\nCare about the environment and need a laptop this spring? Coming in April, the Aspire Vero 16 (AV16-71P) is an example of Acer's commitment to carbon neutrality, featuring a chassis made with more than 70% post-consumer recycled plastic and bio-based oyster shells - yes, made in part from oysters! - and with durability that meets MIL-STD-810H certification. A CES 2025 Innovation Award Honoree, the \"green but mean\" 16-inch laptop has an Intel Core Ultra processor (Series 2), up to 32GB of memory, and up to 2 terabytes of storage.\n\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable\n\nOK, so it's only a concept to show what's possible, but Lenovo showed off its ambitious ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable PC, a dual-screen laptop that extends the screen upward rather than folding it (or, fold two screens together, which is what other PC makers have done). Countless applications come to mind for being able to extend a screen a few inches with the simple press of a button, be it for productivity, creativity, or entertainment.\n\nOnePlus 13\n\nWhile CES isn't as much of a phone show compared to Mobile World Congress (MWC) in March, OnePlus launched its new flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 13, powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, the Android-based OxygenOS 15 platform (with AI enhancements), and a new camera layout. (Actually, the cameras are quite extraordinary.) One of the colors, Midnight Ocean, is the first phone to feature micro-fiber vegan leather, for a more luxurious feel, while the Arctic Dawn model introduces the first-ever surface-based glass coating. That, and OnePlus 13 is the first phone with both the IP68 and IP69 rating, for extra water- and dust-protection.\n\nGarmin inReach Messenger Plus\n\nWhile the latest iPhone and Samsung smartphones support satellite connectivity for when you're off the grid, it's for emergency purposes only, plus there are limitations on how to message contacts or SOS services. Winner of a \"2025 Best of Innovation in Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps,\" Garmin's inReach Messenger Plus satellite communicator is a small device that wireless connects to your smartphone for group chats, sharing images or voice recordings with friends and family (such as wanting to show the view from a remote cabin in the woods). It works in conjunction with the Garmin Messenger companion app for smartphones. The battery last weeks and can charge up a phone, too.\n\nTCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus\n\niPads are great - for the indoors. If you want to read an ebook by the pool or watch a midday movie on a backyard deck, it's virtually impossible to see the screen. Instead, TCL showed off its next-gen NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet, a super thin 11.5-inch Android slate with TCL's NXTPAPER 4.0 display, an anti-glare matte screen that still yields great color, brightness and sharpness, in any environment. With the press of a button long the side of the tablet, NXTPAPER 11 Plus goes into a greyscale e-ink mode for reading ebooks. Love it. Due out the \"first half of 2025,\" the device will also support Google's \"Circle to Search\" feature for quickly looking up info, while the \"Smart Voice Memo function\" can transcribe and summarize recordings.\n\nGovee Gaming Pixel Light\n\nIt's like Lite-Brite for the 21 century. The Govee Gaming Pixel Light is a panel that displays pixel art, including built-in videogame-related content - plus it's the first that supports \"text-to-light\" AI-generated lighting effects, allowing you to type what you want on the Govee app and it'll appear on the board. Upload animated gifs or images, or for more of retro feel, it's also a speaker that plays 8-bit music with your pixel art. Ideal for mounting to a wall or sitting on a tabletop, you can also choose to display more practical info like time, real-time weather updates, sports schedules or stock quotes.\n\nTP-Link Tapo DL110\n\nDespite its minimalist design, there's a lot going on under the hood of the TP-Link Tapo DL100 Smart Wi-Fi Door Lock, including six ways to unlock the door: by fingerprint, keypad, Tapo app on a smartphone, Bluetooth, Smart Assistant, or with included backup keys. The companion app also lets you remotely manage the weatherproof lock, monitor entry logs, and create temporary codes for guests to gain access to your home, such as a babysitter, cleaning person, dog walker, or technician.\n\neufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1\n\nThe \"eufy\" brand may be best know for its security cameras but its versatile vacuum sucked up some praise at CES. Winner of a 2025 \"Best of Innovation\" award, the aptly-named eufy Robot Vacuum 3-in-1 (model no. E20) is the world's first detachable combo robot vacuum, meaning it can autonomously clean your home or can become a cordless stick vac or handheld vacuum for when you want to take control. Other features include a five-stage filtration system, large-capacity dust cup, and auto-empty station that can hold up to 75 days of dirt, dust and pet hair (before emptying).\n\nRoborock Saros Z70\n\nWhile there were many impressive robo-vacs the CES 2025 - including Narwal's Freo Z Ultra that cleverly maneuvers around obstacles (even charging cables or shoelaces as thin as 5 millimeters) - it's hard not to be blown away by the first robotic vacuum and mop hybrid with a retractable arm that extends out of the top when needed. If the Saros Z70's AI-powered camera detects an object in its path, like an errant sock or tissue lying in the middle of the room, it can literally extend a small robotic arm, pick it up and drive it over to where it should be (like a hamper for the sock or a waste basket for the tissue). Wow.\n\nKirin Electric Salt Spoon\n\nWeird, yes. A little big? Sure. But does it work? You bet. Instead of consuming flavorless food because it's low in sodium, journalists at CES tried out Kirin's \"smart spoon,\" which sends an electric current through the utensil to your tongue, which tricks your tastebuds into thinking your food is saltier than it is. The handle of the spoon houses the product's power and settings, such as four different saltiness options. The idea is that we'd ingest salt for a healthier diet, but don't expect this Japanese product to debut in the U.S. any time soon.\n\nReolink Duo 3\n\nWhile there were many camera systems on display at CES, the Reolink Duo 3, the first 16-megapixel dual-lens PoE (Power over Ethernet) security camera. There's also the Duo 3 Wi-Fi, featuring a dual-band (Wi-Fi 6) wireless connection. Winner of an IDA Design Award \"Honorable Mention,\" these cameras offer an ultra-wide 180-degree field of view, motion tracking (with time stamp), night vision, two-way audio, and up to 512GB of storage. Reolink also bowed the Argus 4 Pro, a 4K 180-degree color night vision battery camera, and Altas PT Ultra, a 4K continuous recording battery camera.\n\nRing + Kidde\n\nLeading home fire safety brand Kidde has joined forces with one of the biggest home security camera companies, Ring, to announce a 2025 collection of Smart Smoke and Combination Alarms (Smoke + CO). Essentially, the Kidde detectors/alarms will have integrated Ring technology, so users can receive real-time smoke and CO alerts through the Ring app and opt into professional monitoring and emergency dispatch service through a new Ring 24/7 Smoke & CO Monitoring subscription (about $5 per month). These new, collaborative solutions were showcased at CES 2025.\n\nXoMotion\n\nBilled as the world's most advanced wearable robotic exoskeleton, XoMotion from Vancouver, Canada's Human In Motion Robotics Inc. is designed to assist patients with mobility impairments due to spinal cord injuries, stroke, and other neurological conditions. This lower-limb medical device helps with standing up and walking through self-balancing and hands-free functionality, and can be utilized in rehab centers and hospitals to lighten the cognitive load and physical strain on therapists. XoMotion recently received Health Canada approval for sales in Canada and is currently undergoing clinical trials for FDA approval in the United States.\n\nYarbo\n\nAs seen at ShowStopers at CES 2025, Yarbo was designed to be the very first multi-purpose yard robot, to autonomously handle more than 20 kinds of demands, including lawn mowing, snow blowing, leaf blowing, tree and bush trimming, liquid spraying, and more. Along with the core 'bot, you'll choose add-ons based on the task you need help with. The year-round modular machine features patented precise position and navigation, smart obstacle avoidance, a wireless charging mat, route planning tech, and support for app and remote control. Yarbo can also be programed in various modes like Patrol, Tow, Follow Me, and more.\n\nChamelo by Aura\n\nThe world's first color-adjustable eyeglasses made its debut at the CES 2025, with Aura's aptly-named Chamelo (as in \"chameleon\") Prismatic Collection. Featuring patented color-changing lenses, users simply touch the temple arm to change between \"vibrant hues\" - like blue, purple, red or gray - based on your outfit or mood. Camelo is a 2025 Honoree in Fashion Tech.\n\nJBL Tour ONE M3\n\nAlong with support for Hi-Res Bluetooth, Lossless Audio and True Adaptive Noise Cancelling 2.0 technology (via eight microphones), JBL's latest over-ear headphones are the first to include JBL SMART Tx, a small wireless audio transmitter that lets users hear audio from virtually any USB-C or analog audio source, such as an inflight entertainment system, PC, tablet, or TV. This includes full control over the wireless audio, like call management, EQ settings, and support for \"Auracast,\" a Bluetooth feature that allows audio to be broadcasted from one device to many others without the need for pairing. The JBL Tour ONE M3 will launch in April.\n\nApollon by Sky Labs\n\nNamed an \"Honoree\" in the Artificial Intelligence category at the CES 2025 Innovation Awards, Sky Labs' Apollon (project name) is a wearable smart ring and wrist-worn silicone module from the 10-year-old South Korean healthcare startup. Together, these devices are designed to comprehensively monitor vital health indicators, including SpO₂ (arterial blood oxygen saturation), irregular pulse, pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and skin temp. Sky Labs says this solution was engineered with hospitalized patients in mind, as Apollon supports extensive health data tracking and analysis. On a related note, Sky Labs' CART BP pro is a ring-type ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device.\n\nSmart \"Pins\"\n\nLuci, I'm hooome! Actually, Luci will know if you're home, if you're talking about the wearable \"temporal computer platform\" by Toronto's OpenInterX Inc. This 2025 Honoree in Artificial Intelligence is a two-part and \"privacy-first\" system, powered by Life OS, designed to capture and share your world, as experiences from your perspective. This is handled through the Luci Pin, a wearable eye with up to 4 hours of continuous video (via its ultrawide lens and dual microphones -- with privacy switch - and the Luci Hub, a mobile processing center that houses the AI's \"brain.\" Maybe it'll live up to the hype unlike last year's Rabbit R1 wearable AI?\n\nEven AI Smart Glasses\n\nEven the most functional \"smart glasses\" won't be worn unless they look good. This is what Even Realities looked to accomplish with its Even G1, a pair of smart glasses that combine a stylish design with useful augmented reality features. Each lens is a combination of an optical lens and a display lens, bonded together with an eco-friendly adhesive, that lets you do things like: translate what someone is saying into your mother tongue in real time; get navigation directions to a chosen destination; have words appear you can as a teleprompter; see hands-free notifications from your phone; and access an AI virtual assistant. Also worth calling out is Gygeslabs' Halliday Smart Glasses, which impressed at CES.\n\nHisense FreshVault French Door Refrigerator\n\nWith the industry's first vacuum-sealed drawer, the Hisense FreshVault French Door Refrigerator includes a low-oxygen environment that keeps meat fresh for up to five days, saving money and reducing waste, while the antibacterial liners are said to keep the fridge 99.999% bacteria-free, for added peace of mind. The VersaTemp+ middle drawer offers variable temperature control via its three-layer vacuum glass door with anti-UV and Low-E (\"low emissivity\") coating. On the outside, a black stainless-steel finish and flush door design create a modern aesthetic, and includes features such as a tall ice and water dispenser to support those popular tumblers like Stanley-branded \"Quencher\" cups.\n\nKara Pod\n\nWhile air-to-water machines (a.k.a. atmospheric water generators) aren't new - they convert water vapor in the air into drinking water - Kara Pod is not only the least expensive home unit at $299 but is also the world's first countertop device that can also brew you a coffee! In other words, it's a self-refilling coffee machine. As hinted at in the name, Kara Pod is a pod-based coffee machine that takes fully compostable coffee pods made of plant-based fibers. The company Kara Water says it can produce up to 3.2 liters of drinking water per day, which is enough for 18 cups of coffee or seven bottles of water. Recognized as a CES Innovation Awards 2025 Honoree, Kara Pod is \"coming soon\" and will be available in black, white, and beige.\n\nCRAFT GEN 3 Pro+\n\nWith a mission to save beer drinkers from \"boring brew,\" Exobrew's CRAFT Gen 3, a CES 2025 Honoree in Home Appliances, is an app-or website-controlled appliance that lets you craft 1.6 gallons in 3 to 30 days - even if you're a beginner brewer. Promising professional-quality beverages, Exobrew's single vessel, with reverse heater/cooler technology, can craft a wide range of beer styles using fresh all-grain ingredients, whether you're craving Lagers, IPAs, Weizens (wheat beer) or Stouts, as well as ciders and kombucha. Follow along with pre-made recipes or unleash your creativity by \"drafting\" your own.\n\nLG Indoor Garden\n\nDon't be fooled by its classic floor-standing lamp design: LG's latest indoor gardening appliance (nope, no name yet) is packed with modern features. Allowing users to produce fresh home-grown greens and other plants, herbs, flowers and fruits, it features a height-adjustable and downward-facing LED light to promote growth, a 1.5-gallon-capacity tank that automatically dispenses water (and/or seeds) based on the number and variety of plants being grown. UIt also supports the ThinQ app, if you want to manage cultivation schedules, adjust lighting settings and monitor plant growth from any location. Despite its 20-plant, four-seed-kit capacity, this condo-friendly appliance can be placed virtually anywhere.\n\nSamsung Air-to-Water Heat Pump\n\nWhile Samsung has been selling heat pumps in the European market since 2009, the company is expending to North America for the first time, by introducing the first air-to-water heat pump lineup - the EHS Mono R32 HT Quiet and new Slim Fit EHS ClimateHub units - both equipped with AI Home, including a 7-inch LCD screen on the product to monitor and optimize performance. A slim fit design of the units allows them to be installed in various locations throughout the home, and despite a smaller footprint it houses components such as magnetic filters, three-way valves and an expansion vessel for space heating. Optional, but once these units are connected to Samsung's SmartThings Energy platform, an AI Energy Mode translates to reduced energy use by up to 17 percent, says Samsung.\n\nBackup by BioLite\n\nComing in May 2025, Backup By BioLite was created to be an affordable and easy-to-install home back-up solution in the event of a power outage. You can keep your appliances and other devices running through a blackout, which kicks in automatically when needed, delivering up to 60 hours of energy. The company, BioLite, says its Backup solution can be installed in as little as 30 minutes, in virtually any room: Plug Backup into a standard wall outlet, and then plug your critical devices into Backup. No rewiring or electricians needed. At just 2.8 inches deep, it can be tucked behind a fridge, under a bed, or left in a cabinet. The Backup app sends alerts about outages and can schedule usage to save money on your monthly utility bill.\n\nBLUETTI SwapSolar Ecosystem MultiCooler\n\nWhether you use it on camping trips or while RVing, or during natural disasters at home when the power goes out, this 2025 Honoree in Sustainability & Energy/Power is the world's first LFP (lithium iron phosphate battery)-powered multi-cooler on wheels, with four ways to charge, a companion app, and an integrated ice maker. Along with three days of power, removable battery packs and solar charging ensure an even longer runtime, if needed. It boasts up to 1,800 watts of continuous output and 2,700 watts of lifting power (thanks to its twin batteries), so you can also charge up multiple devices simultaneously with its several USB-A, USB-C and AC ports.\n\nGoPro HERO13 Black\n\nAlready available for purchase and garnering positive reviews, the new GoPro HERO13 proves to be a significant update to its action camera line-up. Despite having the same processor and sensor as the HERO12, advanced features includes a new interchangeable lens system (supporting ultrawide, macro, and anamorphic) that are automatically detected when attached; four neutral density filters (4, 8, 16, and 32); better battery life; improved high-dynamic range (HDR) performance; a magnetic mounting system; and optional USB-C passthrough.\n\nHOVERAir X1 by Zero Zero Robotics\n\nFounded by two Stanford PhDs, Zero Zero Robotics showcased its HOVERAir lineup of self-flying cameras at CES, including the pocket-sized HOVERAir X1, the action-centric HOVERAir X1 PRO, and the pro-grade HOVERAir X1 PROMAX. Unveiled at CES, the X1 weighs just 125 grams and allows owners to shoot aerial photography without the need for a controller or app, thanks to five pre-programmed flight paths, including Hover, Follow, Zoom Out, Orbit, and Bird's Eye. Video resolution tops 2.7K, while the PRO and PROMAX models, launched last summer, offer 4K/60fps (frames per second) video and 8K/30fps video (with 4K/120fps slow-motion capabilities), respectively.\n\nROG Flow Z13 Gaming Tablet\n\nPortability meets power with the 2025 ROG Flow Z13, a versatile 13-inch gaming tablet on a kickstand you can prop up, pair with a Bluetooth controller, and game on your airplane tray, in a dorm room, or just about anywhere. The 2.5K ROG Nebula 180Hz touchscreen display includes Pantone validation for 100% DCI P3 color coverage, a durable CNC aluminum unibody chassis, and 70-watt-hour battery for up to 10 hours of usage. It's considered a \"2-in-1\" tablet as you can add a laptop-like keyboard for when you need to get work done.\n\nMSi Claw 8 AI+\n\nHandheld PCs have been an emerging and popular category for gamers on the go, and we saw a couple at CES worth calling out. Along with Lenovo's Legion Go S that runs on Valve's SteamOS platform, we really liked the MSi Claw 8 AI+, which is powered by Intel's new Core Ultra 7 258V with 2nd Gen ARC graphics. A powerful and efficient processor, this latest Claw computer has a new and larger 8-inch display, long-lasting 82-watt-hour battery (providing more than four hours of gameplay on even the most demanding titles) and console-like controls to grip on each side of the screen.\n\nEmoTense Real-Time Haptic Response XR Suit\n\nSouth Korea's iPOP Co. - a company with more than 30 patents in motion capture and haptic (vibration) feedback technologies - chose CES to showcase its wearable EmoTense XR Suit, that adds more realism to mixed reality experiences. Featuring a two-layer haptic module that combines vibrations and electrical muscle stimulation, it adds a tangible layer to a digital experience, so the wearer feels what's happening inside their headset. In a game, for example, if someone is shot in a sci-fi military game, they'll sense the impact on a specific part of their body.\n\nELEHEAR Beyond Pro\n\nAlready enjoying success with its over-the-counter and relatively affordable ELEHEAR Beyond hearing aids, the company is letting CES attendees test-drive its next-gen AI-enhance hearing aids at CES, dubbed ELEHEAR Beyond Pro, available later in 2025. Along with its \"several upgrades\" to enhance sound clarity and offer new convenience features, Beyond Pro will offer a new Champagne colorway, proprietary VOCCLEAR technology and 20 customizable masking sounds. The hearing aids will also feature real-time AI-powered translation that supports live translations across multiple languages. ELEHEAR says the app will be easy-to-use and customizable and will let iPhone or Android users enjoy music and calls, with personalized compensation adjustments and volume controls.\n\nGrandPad\n\nWhile it debuted in 2024, GrandPad was at CES to show off the latest features of its purpose-built tablet for aging Americans age 75 and older. Simple to use, this 8-inch tablet houses large app \"buttons,\" bright colors, and a GrandPad app for the administrator (such as a family caregiver) who can add photos, expand the line-up of games, and more. GrandPad comes charged out of the box and lays against a charging dock to juice up, while simultaneously propping up the device for hands-free video calls. A new \"Grandie\" AI feature serves as a personal companion.\n\nField Labs Compass Wearable\n\nAlready available for $99 (down from $169) as a special launch price, Compass Wearable is a small and lightweight device worn around the neck that, when paired with a companion app, can automatically transcribe audible conversations into text to read later -- no need to remember to press record. AI then summarizes discussions, generates reminders and lists, and may prompt you to ask follow-up questions about the captured notes. While busy professionals can benefit from this clever tool, it could be especially helpful for those struggling with memory issues, such as Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, since conversations are recorded and transcribed. Battery life lasts a day between charges. The price includes 10 hours per month of the Compass X subscription service, while an unlimited subscription costs $14 a month (billed annually).\n\nAbbott Labs Lingo\n\nFrom Abbott - a global leader in diabetes care and the creators of the wearable Freestyle Libre biosensor that measures glucose levels - comes its latest high-tech solution, Abbott Lingo. Worn on the back of the arm for up to 14 days, it continuously measuring glucose levels in interstitial fluid; the biosensor then sends data to a smartphone app in real time (only iPhone, to start), which provides personalized insights and coaching - to help you understand your metabolism and learn new eating habits and perhaps lifestyle changes to be a healthier you. Lingo costs $49 for one 14-day sensor, $89 for two sensors and four-week plan, or $249 for six sensors and 12-week plan, and is designed for people 18 years and older who are not on insulin.\n\nPoint Biotech\n\nAccording to Point Biotech, the incidence of malignant lymphoma in dogs can be up to five times higher than in humans. As such, early detection of tumors can be critical for treatment, though conventional optical imaging systems can detect tumors in only a dark room - until now. Point Biotech has developed a handheld tumor-detecting tool that works even in ambient light, with the help of testing by researchers at Harvard Medical School.\n\nFaceHeart CardioMirror\n\nBilled as the first AI-powered smart mirror for cardiac health assessments, FaceHeart CardioMirror from FaceHeart Corp. can record a 45-second \"selfie\" that may detect heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AFib), with 90 percent accuracy, says the company. It can also provide many other health-related readings, such as heart and respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), blood pressure, heart rate variability (HRV), a \"Stress Index,\" and more. and Stress Index. This 2025 Honoree in Digital Health is utilizing its FDA-cleared remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology and deep learning models for these AI analyses.\n\nKingSmith Fitness' WalkingPad Treadmill, Rower\n\nUnderstandably, those who live in small spaces, such as an apartment or condo unit, may not want a treadmill to take up half a room. At CES 2025, KingSmith Fitness showed off its latest treadmills and rowers, which are not only compact but foldable for when you need to put them away until your next exercise session. For example, the new WalkingPad Treadmill cleverly collapses and slides under a couch, while the tri-fold water rower can be folded into a compact cube. The Z3 Series WalkingPad Treadmills introduce a 15-degree tilted \"EasyView\" display that improves visibility and reduces neck strain, while side handles help users stow the equipment away when not in use.\n\nHonda 0 Series Prototypes\n\nInitially making its CES debut in 2024, Honda let attendees of the CES 2025 kick the tires on a pair of its 0 Series EV models the Japanese automotive giant is set to introduce globally in 2026. Also demonstrating its original vehicle operating system (OS) with Level 3 automatous technologies, along with a new energy service, as a part of its initiatives toward its goal of carbon neutrality. Supporting Honda's \"thin, light and wise\" approach, the 0 Series concepts showed sleek and sporty designs (one sedan, one midsize SUV), each boasting \"excellent aerodynamic performance,\" efficient electric power, and next-gen infotainment experiences.\n\nAptera's Solar-Powered EV\n\nAfter launching as a \"solar mobility\" company in 2019, Aptera has accepted $1,7 billion in preorders, with nearly 50,000 vehicles reserved, for its flagship vehicle, also referred to as Aptera, which means \"wingless flight\" or \"without wings\" (depending on whom you ask). Actually, it looks like a dolphin. On display at CES 2025, the solar electric vehicle requires no charging for most daily use - up to 40 miles of solar-powered driving per day - with the option to plug in to charge for 400 miles on a single charge in under an hour. Aptera says it's in its \"final developmental\" stage before it kicks off series production.\n\nLand Aircraft Carrier\n\nAnd now for something completely different. Chinese automaker Xpeng AeroHT, a division of electric car maker Xpeng, garnered buzz at CES for its wild Land Aircraft Carrier concept. It might be best described as an electric minivan that launches a large, foldable passenger drone out of the back. Yes, you read that correctly. So, after you drive to your destination in the six-wheeled extended range \"Mothership\" vehicle - say, to a beach - two people can then climb into the eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) drone, to soar the friendly skies for an afternoon of sightseeing. The minivan does have a combustion engine at the front which sends power to the car's electric motors and battery, which also juices up the drone. Xpeng AeroHT said production and deliveries will start sometime in 2026, in China.\n\nHolographic Windshield Display\n\nAt CES, global automotive supplier Hyundai Mobis showcased its Holographic Windshield Display, a first-of-its-kind display that projects driving information across the entire width of the windshield. This augmented reality (AR) technology was designed to enhance driving visibility while displaying info like safety alerts, navigation and infotainment, \"that seamlessly spans from the driver's seat to the passenger's seat,\" says Hyundai Mobis. Co-developed with renowned German optics company ZEISS, this futuristic display was featured in Kia's electric vehicle, the EV9, exclusively for its unveiling at CES - and should be on the road by 2027.\n\nLIVALL PikaBoost 2 E-Bike Convention Kit\n\nA CES 2025 Honoree in Sustainability & Energy/Power, LIVALL PikaBoost 2 is the follow up to the company's e-bike conversion kit, designed to convert traditional bicycles into electric bikes. It consists mostly of a device that mounts onto the back of the bike seat, with a mechanism that touches the back wheel, and houses an integrated motor (500 watts of peak power), battery (up to 59 miles of range), control system and LED taillights, to give cyclists an on-demand power boost. There's even a fall detection and SOS alert system to provide enhanced visibility and added safety for riders and those around them. LIVALL Riding, the company that has more than 180 patents, says installation can be done in under a minute.\n\nVueroid S1 Infinite Dash Cam\n\nAvailable by the spring, Vueroid's S1 Infinite is an AI-powered 4K dashboard camera (\"dashcam\") that can capture video and audio evidence in the event of an accident or incident. Along with its patented Image Signal Processing (ISP) technology held by Vueroid's parent company, NC& (South Korea's largest dashcam maker), for clearer videos of license plates and faces, the VUEROID Hub app utilizes AI-powered deep learning algorithms to restore unclear video with a few simple taps. Other features include custom-engineered hybrid lenses, advanced SONY STARVIS sensors, premium night vision mode, GPS for precise location data, Wi-Fi for fast file transfer, and a parking surveillance feature.\n\nUniWhale AI Baby Companion\n\nHonored with the CES 2025 Innovation Awards in the Digital Health category, the UniWhale AI Baby Companion from SiriuXense is a wearable sensor for infants (and companion device that stays in the nursery) that fuses physiological sensing with advanced bio-acoustic technology to provide real-time monitoring of vital signs and predictive safety alerts for parents. For example, between its sound- and bio-sensors, it could detect spit-up issues, foreign objects in the airway, heart rate and respiration, body position (on back, on front, or active), and more. It also gives personalized AI-generated lullabies and soothing for babies.\n\nTech expert Marc Saltzman writes for more than 20 publications including USA TODAY, Forbes, Reader's Digest, Yahoo/AOL, Costco Connection and AARP.

I eat a few portions of these things every day and my tummy thanks me for it.\n\nBut digestive health is important not only because of the way it makes us feel: digestive health can impact many other areas of our wellbeing, including immune response, weight management, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and even mental health.\n\nSo this year we should all resolve to look after our guts. Here's 10 ways to do that.\n\nThis is the big one. Fibre is crucial for making sure our digestive systems run smoothly. The British Nutrition Foundation recommends 30g of fibre a day for adults but the average intake is just 18g. Broadly speaking there are two types: insoluble and soluble. Insoluble fibre is known as \"roughage\" and keeps you regular. Insoluble fibre aka \"prebiotics\" is food for the bacteria in your gut.\n\nAdvice in the past few years has moved away from encouraging people to eat their \"five a day\" fruit and vegetables. Instead, 30 across a week is the number we should be aiming for. These should come from six groups of plants: fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (beans and pulses), nuts and seeds, and herbs and spices.\n\nSo although the numbers are higher, way more things count: olive oil, dark chocolate, coffee, and herb garnishes all contribute to the 30. Eating across all six groups should ensure you get plenty of both soluble and insoluble fibre.\n\nAs well as maintaining a good balance of gut bacteria by feeding them prebiotics, you should aim to add some extra beneficial bacteria too with probiotics.\n\nKraut and kimchi are both vegetable-based ferments that not only contain fibre but also these beneficial probiotic bacteria. They don't set up home in the gut though so it's important to keep eating them regularly to reap the benefits.\n\nTry some kraut as a side dish, in a sandwich or mixed into a salad. It's easy to make your own: simply shred or grate any hard vegetable (cabbage, carrot and beetroot are all good starting places), add any herbs, spices or other flavourings you like and weigh everything together. Calculate 2 or 3 per cent of this weight and add that much sea salt. Massage the veg until it has softened slightly and you have a little brine in the bottom of the bowl then pack into a clean jar and weigh down so all the veg is under the brine (you can use a cabbage core or half an onion for this). Keep your jar at room temperature for a week or so until the kraut is tangy then move it to the fridge.\n\nSome of my favourites include carrot-based kraut with seeds. Delicious with hummus and flatbread. Or red-cabbage and beetroot kraut alongside a cheeseboard instead of chutney. Kimchi goes beautifully with eggs for breakfast, is the perfect accompaniment to a cheese toastie or makes a simple, tasty dinner with rice, veggies and a fried egg.\n\nIf you're buying these ferments, always make sure you get them from the fridge. Anything on the shelf will have been pasteurised, killing the probiotic bacteria.\n\nKefir is fermented milk and another great source of probiotics. Live yoghurt is good but kefir is even better. You can buy it or make your own. Ask a fermenting friend if they'll share some kefir grains or buy some online (these \"grains\" are nothing to do with wheat or rye but little colonies of micro-organisms that look like cauliflower florets).\n\nI love kefir for breakfast with fruit (fresh or frozen) and a bit of muesli. Or else mix some with oats and a grated apple and leave it overnight for a probiotic take on bircher. I find that if I have some kefir for breakfast, I don't get mid-afternoon sugar cravings.\n\nThere are neurons in our gut, connected to the ones in our brain. The microbes in our gut use them to \"talk\" to our brain, in effect placing orders for what they want to eat.\n\nHaving more of the good bacteria which thrive on fibre, fermented foods etc. means they shout loudest when it comes to your cravings. The science on this is new but convincing: eat the sugar and processed foods that bacteria with bad health outcomes adore and you will want more of the same.\n\nEat fibre and probiotics and a virtuous circle is created. I can't tell you the amount of conversations I've had with people who say that once they start adding sauerkraut, kimchi or kefir to their diet that they actively crave the stuff.\n\nProcessed food isn't a problem: almost all foods are processed. Chopping is a process. Cooking is a process. The things we need to watch for are Ultra Processed Foods, things like emulsifiers, sweeteners, colours, modified starches and oils. There is increasing evidence that a diet rich in UPFs is associated with poor gut health, including serious conditions such as colo-rectal cancers and IBS.\n\nLook out for anything on a list of ingredients that isn't something you would find in a normal home kitchen. There are barcode-scanning apps that can help too. Open Food Facts is clear and easy to use.\n\nDiets high in red meat have been associated with inflammation. You don't have to give it up altogether but try to include plant-based protein in your diet too. Tempeh, tofu, beans, lentils, nuts and seeds are all good sources. If you're cooking with minced meat try swapping out half for lentils which increases fibre and decreases cost at the same time.\n\nBefore gut health became a hot topic in the past few years, sleep was probably the facet of wellbeing that got the most attention. But the two are interlinked. Scientists have found that a diverse microbiome is associated with better sleep but also vice versa.\n\nStudies have also shown that eating earlier in the evening (ideally three hours or more before bedtime) leads to better digestion and less chance of interrupted sleep.\n\nGut bacteria ferment soluble fibre into short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which suppress inflammatory microbes. Studies have shown that regular exercise increases SCFA-producing microbes in the gut.\n\nBe present when you eat. Digestion starts with chewing so pay attention to each bite: how the food feels in your mouth and how full you are. Then pay attention to how you feel after the meal. This awareness can help you make better choices.\n\nAlong with all that fibre, it's important to drink plenty of water to keep things moving through your gut. Cut down on alcohol too which can be dehydrating but also damage the gut lining.","source":{"uri":"inews.co.uk","dataType":"news","title":"inews.co.uk"},"authors":[],"image":"https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SEI_235371441.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C677px&resize=1200%2C675","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.1294117647058823,"wgt":474113184,"relevance":12},{"uri":"8492466982","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"10:05:37","dateTime":"2025-01-09T10:05:37Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T10:05:16Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-update-november-2024","title":"Afghanistan: Humanitarian Update, November 2024 - Afghanistan","body":"Afghanistan's Climate Crisis: Urgent Action Needed After COP29\n\nAfghanistan is grappling with a climate crisis that continues to devastate lives, disrupt livelihoods and escalate humanitarian needs. Despite contributing less than 0.01 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, Afghanistan is one of the top 10 countries most affected by climate change, with extreme weather events worsening each year.\n\nIn 2023, Afghanistan entered its third consecutive year of drought-like conditions, following the worst drought in three decades in 2022. About 60 per cent of the population depends on rainfed agriculture, making them highly vulnerable to shifting precipitation patterns, which threaten their already precarious food security. The changing climate is also exacerbating glacier melt, reducing snowpack and drastically lowering water availability -- especially in urban areas. Desertification, which has affected over 75 per cent of the land in northern, western and southern regions, further degrades soil and impacts agricultural productivity. As a result, poverty and displacement are increasing, with families forced to migrate in search of basic survival.\n\nAbdul Ghani, a resident of Nimroz Province, shares the dire situation. \"We used to grow watermelon, melon and wheat, but two years ago, we stopped planting because there was no water. Our livestock died of hunger and nobody was buying them because they were so skinny.\" Abdul Ghani's village has shrunk from 125 families to just 60, as drought and poverty continue to force families to leave in search of better opportunities.\n\nAfghanistan's climate crisis is compounded by the country's ongoing humanitarian challenges. In 2024, an estimated 23.7 million people in Afghanistan are in need of life-saving aid, yet humanitarian action alone is insufficient to address the climate-related vulnerabilities affecting the most vulnerable populations.\n\nThis year, Afghanistan has also faced devastating flooding, affecting over 170,000 people across all 34 provinces. Approximately 500 people have been killed and more than 800 injured. Tens of thousands of houses have also been destroyed or damaged.[1] These floods, along with droughts, serve as stark reminders of the growing unpredictability and intensity of climate impacts in Afghanistan.\n\nIn his closing statement at COP29, UN Secretary-General António Guterres highlighted the critical need for financial support to developing countries, including Afghanistan, which are facing both the devastating impacts of climate change and economic instability. He stressed that \"finance [is] priority number one\" and emphasized that \"developing countries, swamped by debt, pummeled by disasters, and left behind in the renewables revolution, are in desperate need of funds.\" Afghanistan, already grappling with severe economic decline since August 2021, urgently requires swift access to concessional finance and debt relief to address its mounting climate challenges.\n\nSecretary-General Guterres also underscored that COP29 agreements must be honoured in full and on time, with commitments quickly turned into tangible action. He urged governments to fulfill their pledges and speed up the energy transition, particularly by reducing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General's call for the full implementation of COP29 agreements serves as a crucial reminder for the international community to support countries like Afghanistan, which are on the frontlines of climate change. The transition to a greener, more resilient future for Afghanistan depends on increased international solidarity and immediate action on climate finance.[2]\n\nCOP29 offered hope for a global shift toward stronger climate action, but for Afghanistan, it's clear that progress must be rapid and sustained. The country cannot wait for future commitments to be fulfilled -- it needs the support of the global community now to face the challenges of today's climate crisis. Immediate action is needed to protect lives and help people adapt over the longer-term.\n\nThe Effects of the Climate Crisis on Afghanistan's Farmers: Baz Gul's Story\n\nAs the world grapples with the escalating effects of the climate crisis, farmers around the globe face unprecedented challenges. In Afghanistan, where agriculture is not just a livelihood but a way of life, adaptation is crucial. Baz Gul, a 58-year-old farmer with 40 years of experience, shares his firsthand account of how climate change, agricultural practices and humanitarian aid intersect -- highlighting the urgent need for sustainable solutions for rural farming communities.\n\nBaz Gul has practiced rain-fed agriculture, cultivating cotton, eggplant, okra and melon across his six hectares of farmland in the Dawlatabad District of Faryab Province. With a large family of 46 members, farming is vital not only for sustenance but also for the economic wellbeing of his household. However, in recent years, the adverse effects of the climate crisis have dramatically altered the agricultural practices that once sustained him.\n\n\"The weather has changed significantly. In the past few years, we've faced consecutive droughts that led to meagre harvests and subsequently, the loss of our indigenous seeds. In 2024, we finally received substantial rain, but it was too late to plant and severe floods washed away our topsoil,\" Baz Gul says.\n\nBaz Gul's situation is not unique. Across Afghanistan, farmers face uncertainty due to shifting weather patterns. His dependence on rainwater for irrigation, in the context of poor and unreliable water management systems, highlights a fundamental vulnerability in farming. Rainfall, once a reliable source of nourishment for crops, is now either extremely scarce or the cause of catastrophic flooding. \"We are in dire need of water for both irrigation and household use. Without proper systems to capture and manage this water, we risk losing everything,\" Baz Gul adds.\n\nBaz Gul stresses the importance of building water dams to preserve rainwater for the dry farming season. \"There are three feasible sites in Faryab where dams could be constructed to store large volumes of water. This water could then be used for irrigation and significantly improve our farming outcomes,\" he explains.\n\nIn the face of this crisis, Baz Gul has received assistance from humanitarian partners like the World Food Programme and local agricultural departments, which have provided crucial resources such as fertilizer and food during extreme droughts and flooding. \"These humanitarian efforts have been vital during my family's struggles,\" he acknowledges. However, reliance on such aid is a short-term solution to a long-term problem, underscoring the need for sustainable agricultural practices.\n\n\"While we appreciate the immediate relief, we desire durable solutions that will help us become self-sufficient. We need the tools and resources to sustain ourselves without perpetual reliance on humanitarian assistance,\" Baz Gul stresses.\n\nLooking ahead, Baz Gul urges de facto authority officials to support farmers by developing comprehensive water management systems, providing drought-resistant seed varieties and supplying agricultural machinery. \"If we secure a good harvest, we can contribute to our local economy and provide for our families without needing aid.\" He also appeals to the international donor community: \"Support us in building water dams and improving our irrigation systems. Help us transform our farming practices so that we can become self-reliant. This will not only alleviate our immediate struggles but build a more sustainable future for our community.\"\n\nDespite the numerous challenges posed by the climate crisis, Baz Gul remains hopeful for the future of farming in Afghanistan. He envisions a day when effective water management allows farmers to cultivate with confidence, reducing their vulnerability to climate variability. \"With the right support and infrastructure, we can reverse the trend of wasted resources and enhance our agricultural productivity,\" he says.\n\nBaz Gul's story illustrates the resilience of farmers affected by the climate crisis. It underscores the urgent need for global initiatives focused on water management and sustainability in agriculture. As nations come together to combat climate threats, stories like Baz Gul's illuminate the path toward building a sustainable future -- where farmers are not only survivors but also essential contributors to their economies and communities. For meaningful change to happen, tangible actions and partnerships must be prioritized, ensuring that communities like Baz Gul's can thrive in the face of adversity.[3]\n\nHow 6.7 Billion Dollars in Humanitarian Aid Has Shaped Afghanistan's Recovery Since 2021\n\nAfghanistan has received approximately $6.7 billion in humanitarian funding since the Taliban takeover in August 2021. This support coincided with the country's most severe humanitarian crisis in decades, driven by severe economic decline, food insecurity, the worst drought in 30 years and a collapsing public health system. In 2023, 29.2 million people were in need of assistance. Since then, the situation has stabilized, with improvements observed in key sectors such as food security, healthcare, education, protection, sanitation and shelter. However, Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters, climate change and ongoing geopolitical tensions.\n\nHumanitarian efforts have made significant strides in alleviating suffering and preventing a larger-scale disaster. The number of people facing emergency food insecurity has dropped dramatically.\n\nHumanitarian efforts have led to a 14 percentage point reduction in IPC 4 populations, from 8.7 million to 3.1 million and an 8 percentage point reduction in IPC 3 populations, from 14.1 million to 11.6 million. By November 2024, the number of people in IPC 4 conditions is expected to decrease to just 3.1 million, or 7 per cent of the population.\n\nIn addition to food security, there has been a remarkable improvement in malnutrition treatment for children. This achievement is largely attributed to the expansion of nutrition sites, with the number of Moderate Acute Malnutrition and Severe Acute Malnutrition sites nearly doubling since 2021, from 1,585 to 3,333.\n\nThe number of acutely malnourished children receiving treatment more than doubled, from 1.1 million in 2021 to 2.2 million in 2023. By 2024, 1.3 million children have already received treatment and 2.9 million could be treated by the end of the year if the Nutrition Cluster were fully funded.\n\nAccess to primary healthcare has also expanded significantly. The Health Cluster's ability to increase the number of humanitarian health facilities from 422 in January 2022 to 908 in December 2023 has played a pivotal role, driven by the expanded operational presence of partners.\n\nHumanitarian action has expanded access to primary healthcare, with 11.6 million people receiving services by 2023, up from 7.9 million in 2021. Maternal mortality rates have also slightly decreased, from 638 per live births to 620 per 100,000.\n\nShelter assistance has seen a significant increase, with 304,800 people supported in 2023, compared to just 54,700 in 2021.\n\nHowever, as the humanitarian community faces future funding shortfalls, there are concerns that the gains achieved over the past three years could be reversed, leaving millions of Afghans vulnerable once again. Humanitarian actors remain committed to delivering accountable, inclusive and quality assistance. But as the needs grow and funding gaps widen, it is essential to maintain support to avoid a backslide into crisis.[4]\n\n[3] This article was produced with the support of OCHA Afghanistan colleagues at the sub-national level, Nova Ratnanto and Mohammad Haroon Qadery.","source":{"uri":"reliefweb.int","dataType":"news","title":"ReliefWeb"},"authors":[],"image":"https://reliefweb.int/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/previews/44/1a/441afb5d-445c-4231-b6d5-8ed84d3c90d8.png","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.5372549019607843,"wgt":474113137,"relevance":18},{"uri":"8492463029","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"10:05:12","dateTime":"2025-01-09T10:05:12Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T10:02:52Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.news18.com/opinion/opinion-whitelisting-apps-in-india-a-step-towards-a-more-trustworthy-digital-economy-9183150.html","title":"Opinion | Whitelisting Apps In India: A Step Towards A More Trustworthy Digital Economy - News18","body":"A 'Whitelist' is a mechanism to differentiate legitimate apps from illegitimate ones. This could work equally well for all sectors of the digital economy -- be it fintech, gaming, crypto, OTT or social media\n\nIn the last decade, India's internet economy has exploded on the shoulders of the JAM trinity. Digital democratisation, powered by near-universal access to banking, has created a massive market for digital services. With over 900 million smartphone internet connections, the Indian digital ecosystem has shifted drastically from being an exporter of software and skilled labour to becoming the world's largest real-time payment market.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2023, retail digital payments surged 50.8 per cent. Today, our digital ecosystem is pegged to be the fastest-growing market in the world. It accounted for 4.5 per cent of India's GDP in 2014 and is expected to contribute 20 per cent of the GDP by 2026.\n\nLife has certainly changed for the average Indian. The internet economy has unleashed access and convenience like never before. Sectors like e-commerce, health, insurance, and investment have undergone large-scale digital transformation, creating lakhs of opportunities for budding entrepreneurs. Perhaps that's why it's no surprise that several unicorns have become essential partners in our day-to-day lives.\n\nWhile there are several contributors to this mega propulsion, amongst them is the gaming sector. Home to more than 45 crore gamers, including 0.18 crore e-sports players (PWC), Indian online gaming is estimated to reach Rs 66,000 crore, growing at a CAGR of 14.5 per cent between 2023 and 2028.\n\nThis fast-paced growth, however, has come hand-in-hand with a host of cyber-related issues. Today, we see a proliferation of cases where consumers have fallen into the traps of unscrupulous entities, leading to financial loss, among other things. If I were to highlight some recent examples:\n\nThese are just three examples, but they highlight an important theme - that the end-user was not aware that the apps they were using were illegal, and that their data was being used for unlawful activities.\n\nIn the gaming sector, a reasonable approach to tackling this menace could be to create a 'Whitelist' framework. A 'Whitelist', in simple terms, is a mechanism to differentiate the legitimate from the illegitimate businesses or apps. This could work equally well for all sectors of the digital economy -- be it fintech, gaming, crypto, OTT or social media.\n\nDifferentiating legitimate apps from illegitimate ones might seem like a regulatory puzzle, but it could be simplified by four easy-to-answer questions. To put checks and balances in place, the government must know:\n\nBusinesses that tick the above boxes may be presumed to be operating in good faith and could earn a 'symbol of trust' which would help separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nCyberspace, and therefore the crimes committed in it, thrive on anonymity with nameless, faceless entities. By creating a 'symbol of trust,' a consumer can differentiate between a legitimate business offering lawful and good quality products and services from the illegitimate fly-by-night operators. An offline example of such a symbol of trust is the 'ISI' mark, which has become a standard quality and compliance mark for products since 1950. On one hand, it has helped consumers identify and buy quality products, and on the other, it has set a benchmark for manufacturers who want to do business in the market.\n\nThe digital ecosystem needs similar symbols of trust to assure consumers that the product is legal, authentic and compliant with the digital laws of India. The onus of this trust-building measure should not solely lie on the shoulders of businesses.

Therefore, to stay ahead of the ever-shifting digital curve requires a concerted and coordinated effort between industry, government and society.\n\nThe end goal is the same for everyone: to create guardrails so consumers and industries can be protected from fly-by-night operators.

In 2022, the year much of the world resumed travelling globally after Covid-19 lockdowns, vodka sales volumes in travel retail rebounded by 68%, according to IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. While this is impressive, the category lagged behind the wider spirits sector, which grew by 74% over the same period.\n\nThe picture was markedly brighter for vodkas positioned in the premium-plus price tiers, according to the IWSR data. Higher-priced vodkas grew by 98% in 2022 in volume terms and, more significantly, they are set to post a healthy compound annual growth rate of 11% over the next three years, ahead of both standard-priced vodkas at 5% and overall spirits at 8%, respectively.\n\n\"GTR [vodka] is expected to continue to premiumise with an increased focus on luxury and a shift in focus for GTR as a marketing channel to create a halo effect for larger brands in domestic duty-paid,\" says Emily Neill, chief operations officer of research and operations at IWSR, confirming the category's drive upmarket.\n\nDiageo Global Travel, the owner of the standard Smirnoff and the super-premium Cîroc and Ketel One vodkas, remains bullish about vodka's prospects in travel retail. \"Post-Covid, we have seen a strong recovery in vodka,\" says Nicolas Wyckaert, Diageo Global Travel head of marketing, Tequila & 'Premium Core'. \"This is not just due to travel returning, but its relevance in the 18- to 24-year-old group who are back in travel strongly. \"The growth of Smirnoff Blue has been noticeable as a winner,\" he adds. \"For those looking for something versatile and easy to use, Smirnoff and, indeed, Cîroc resonate. We know that vodka purchasers skew younger. In GTR, 36% of vodka purchasers are Millennials and younger, versus 27% for whisky.\"\n\nFocus on sustainability\n\nPernod Ricard-owned Absolut also sees Millennial and Gen Z travellers as key to its fortunes in travel retail, with a recent activation at Stockholm Arlanda airport highlighting the brand's strong track record of supporting environmental, social and governance (ESG) causes such as sustainability and the LGBTQIA+ community, two issues that are close to the hearts of many younger consumers.\n\n\"The activation incorporated cutting-edge technology, featuring a prominent bottle-silhouette LCD screen that delivered an interactive brand journey, incorporating details on Absolut's roadmap to carbon neutrality, the brand's sustainable wheat journey and much more,\" says Liya Zhang, Pernod Ricard Global Travel Retail's vice-president of marketing. \"It also highlighted the brand's important work to support numerous communities, such as the Absolut Ally initiative, and the implementation of a Safe Spaces programme, collaborating with bars to create welcoming environments for the LGBTQIA+ community.\"\n\nTito's cruises in-house\n\nAnother vodka producer with a glass-half-full view about travel retail's potential is US brand Tito's, which in recent years has been aggressively expanding its presence in the channel.\n\n\"We've seen strong double-digit growth for Tito's Handmade Vodka in duty free so far this year,\" reveals John McDonnell, managing director, international. \"Business has been particularly strong in European markets such as Ireland, Croatia, and Montenegro, to name but a few.\"\n\nWith 35.7 million people expected to take a cruise this year, a 6% increase on pre-Covid 2019, McDonnell also highlights the cruise sector's increasing significance for Tito's. \"The cruise channel is very important to us, so much that we recently made the decision to bring our cruise business in-house (rather than using a broker), and have hired Curran Zinn to join the Tito's team to lead that effort.\n\n\"On many cruise ships, especially in North America, Tito's is poured onboard and has become a successful part of those cruise lines' bar programmes,\" he adds. \"So, that definitely helps our onboard duty free sales as well.\"\n\nSimilarly, Canada's super-premium Crystal Head Vodka, created in 2008 by actor Dan Aykroyd and artist John Alexander Aykroyd, also highlights the cruise sector's growing potential. \"I think cruise will continue to grow,\" argues managing partner Jonathan Hemi. \"They are doing all the right things. They are constantly reinvesting in their businesses, innovating and continually adding value to the consumer's experiences. I am a big fan of their approach.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Like all significant sales channels, it is very competitive to win listings. For us, the key to approaching the cruise channel is to have a strategy that aligns with that particular cruise line. It isn't a one-size-fits-all approach with cruise. It simply can't be. You need to really get to understand each cruise customer and what their customers look for and appreciate. From there, you can build a plan for it.\"\n\nInnovation\n\nWhile vodka remains a core category for travel retailers based in Europe and the Americas, its role in Asia Pacific and the Middle East - two regions expected to fuel growth for the overall duty free industry in the next decade - is much smaller. At Dubai Duty Free, for instance, where Indian expat workers are a key part of the business, vodka only accounted for 7% of liquor sales last year - ahead of categories such as Tequila (1%) and gin (3%) but way behind Scotch whisky at 42%.\n\nAccording to Sharon Beecham, senior vice- president purchasing at Dubai Duty Free, Indians, Sri Lankans and Russians are the retailer's best vodka purchasers, while the top-three-selling vodkas are Grey Goose, Belvedere, and Absolut, respectively. \"The last addition that has performed well in the vodka category was Absolut Wild Berri, which sold 2,800 pieces for a sales value of AED 266,000 (US$72,422),\" she reveals.\n\nOverall, however, Beecham is disappointed by the level of innovation on display in the vodka category. \"Compared with whisky and Tequila, where there are a lot of innovations taking place, vodka doesn't have many,\" she argues. \"Apart from flavoured vodkas, there isn't much innovation coming out of vodka brands that excites customers.\"\n\nBeecham's views may not be shared by all duty free buyers but there is a growing sense that Tequila, albeit with a much smaller market share, has the greater momentum. Yet vodka's appeal to younger legal-drinking-age travellers, its key role in so many classic cocktails, and ongoing premiumisation mean this mature category will remain a must-stock for many years ahead.\n\nSince launching into travel retail onboard EasyJet in April 2023, Welsh super-premium vodka Au, instantly recognisable for its gold bottles and huge social media following, has expanded its presence in the channel rapidly, gaining listings at key UK airports, as well as onboard cross-channel ferry lines DFDS, P&O Ferries, and Irish Ferries.\n\nFurther afield, Au Vodka has won business with the German travel retailer Gebr Heinemann, cruise retailer Harding+, and Bahrain Duty Free. The brand's distributor, GMAX Travel Retail, is confident travel retail listings will soon follow in Asia Pacific.\n\n\"We are initially targeting regions where there are large numbers of UK travellers, as well as major 'party' holiday destinations catering for many nationalities,\" says GMAX founder and director Garry Maxwell, who reveals a one-litre bottle has already been created for travel retail. \"UK passengers are key for instant growth. However, we are finding all nationalities love the brand.\"\n\nFounded by friends Charlie Morgan and Jackson Quinn in 2015, Au Vodka claims to be the fastest-selling super-premium vodka in the UK, with domestic distribution in more than 40 countries.","source":{"uri":"thespiritsbusiness.com","dataType":"blog","title":"The Spirits Business"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/01/vodka-travel-retail-iStock-1496589340.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.3490196078431373,"wgt":474113062,"relevance":12},{"uri":"8492456951","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"09:59:49","dateTime":"2025-01-09T09:59:49Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T09:58:42Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/01/09/adb-raises-pakistans-growth-forecast-to-3-0-for-fy2025/","title":"ADB raises Pakistan's growth forecast to 3.0% for FY2025 - Profit by Pakistan Today","body":"The revision comes as the country experiences improved macroeconomic stability following the approval of the new IMF program\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has increased Pakistan's growth forecast to 3.0% for the fiscal year 2024-25, up from 2.8% projected in September 2024.\n\nThe revision comes as the country experiences improved macroeconomic stability following the approval of the new International Monetary Fund (IMF) program under the Extended Fund Facility in September.\n\nThe ADB report highlights that industrial output is expected to improve with the easing of import restrictions, higher investor confidence, and better access to foreign exchange.

It also aims to revolutionise this area in European agriculture.\n\nThe project is led by coordinator Dan Milbourne from Teagasc and has 17 partners from ten countries, with project targets of critical crop diseases in wheat, potatoes, and grain legumes such as soybean and lupin.\n\nIPMorama will first focus on wheat, potatoes and grain legumes (soy, pea and lupins), looking at important diseases and pests of these species, such as late blight and rust disease. Based on several main steps, the project will develop a whole practice ecosystem for variety-centric pest management.\n\nOne of the main plans for 2025 is to develop tools for breeding resistance and understanding how deployed resistant varieties interact with existing and emerging pathogens and pests.\n\nThe project will boost pest management by collecting and curating a large and comprehensive set of genetic markers for disease resistance in wheat and potato and initiating the development of similar genetic marker sets for grain legumes.\n\nIPMorama aims to initiate several marker-assisted selection-based breeding initiatives to develop germplasm that will contribute to developing varieties resistant to target diseases.\n\nThe deployment of pest-resistant varieties is starting to be developed - especially with wheat and potato - across Europe, along with how they interact with pathogens against which they are bred for resistance.\n\nThere will also be a routine monitoring system set up to assess changes in host susceptibility to wheat due to the emergence of significant new races of yellow rust, stem rust, and leaf rust.\n\nThis will involve an element of stakeholder involvement in the form of training workshops, where representatives from the organisations (e.g. breeders) supplying plant material will be invited.\n\nIPMorama also aims to advance tools in 2025 to identify and assemble resistance genes, facilitating the breeding of crops resistant to pests and diseases. Efforts will focus on ensuring these tools are adaptable to multiple crop species and agricultural conditions.\n\nThe project aims to map the distribution and evolution of pathogen strains across Europe, including monitoring the virulence of pathogens like Phytophthora infestans, the cause of late blight in potatoes, to tailor region-specific IPM strategies.\n\nIPMorama will pilot variety-centric IPM strategies at the farm level. Moving beyond experimental plots, it seeks to validate the practical applicability of integrating resistant varieties with sustainable pest management measures.\n\nThis year, the project will continue to build its stakeholder network to gain insights into feasible exploitation and sustainability strategies.\n\nThe project's website and digital content will highlight progress and foster collaboration, along with a robust communication strategy, including social media campaigns, newsletters, and events to better engage with pest management strategies.\n\nThere will also be training for growers, breeders, and agricultural advisors in IPM techniques during the year, with plans for further expansion and improvements as the project produces more results.\n\nIPMorama will produce actionable recommendations for policymakers, ensuring that its outcomes align with wider EU agricultural goals, including those outlined in the Farm to Fork strategy and Green Deal policies.\n\nStrengthening connections with agricultural networks is one of its key plans, with agricultural networks such as EuroBlight and RustWatch keen to play a role in pest management.\n\nThroughout its course, the project will explore scalable solutions and foster long-term partnerships to ensure its outcomes benefit the agricultural ecosystem beyond the project's duration.","source":{"uri":"innovationnewsnetwork.com","dataType":"news","title":"Innovation News Network"},"authors":[{"uri":"megan_traviss@innovationnewsnetwork.com","name":"Megan Traviss","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/shutterstock_1835141200.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.05098039215686279,"wgt":474112382,"relevance":97},{"uri":"8492428608","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"09:38:39","dateTime":"2025-01-09T09:38:39Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T09:38:18Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/climate-change-to-cut-wheat-rice-yields-by-up-to-10-warn-officials/article69080152.ece","title":"Climate change to cut wheat, rice yields by up to 10%, warn officials","body":"India's rice and wheat output is projected to dip by 6-10 per cent due to climate change, impacting access to affordable food for millions, senior officials have said.\n\nAnother effect of climate change is that sea water is becoming warmer along the coast forcing fish to move away to cooler water in deep sea, which has also hit the fishing community, the officials said.\n\nIndia's wheat production had touched 113.29 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year, which was about 14 per cent of the global output, while rice harvests topped 137 million tonnes.

The findings could help blueberry growers predict, monitor and control the spread of powdery mildew.\n\nThe study shows that the fungus, Erysiphe vaccinii, has in the last 12 years or so spread from its point of origin in the eastern United States to multiple continents.\n\nAs its name suggests, powdery mildew disease causes a white, powdery substance to cover host plants, stealing nutrients and retarding photosynthesis while keeping the host alive. Different species of this fungus affect different plants; wheat, hops, grapes and strawberries, among other plants, have been detrimentally affected by powdery mildew.\n\n\"There are other closely related powdery mildews that affect plants like wild berries or eucalyptus, but these are genetically different from the ones spreading across the world on blueberries,\" Bradshaw said.\n\nIn the study, Bradshaw and his colleagues examined historic and modern plant leaves plagued by powdery mildew. The collection includes 173 samples from North America, Europe, Africa and Asia; one sample analyzed from a North American herbarium was collected over 150 years ago, while the foreign samples were all collected within the past five years. In this study, powdery mildew was first spotted outside North America on a farm in Portugal in 2012, as noted by a co-author of Bradshaw's who was employed by a major berry company.\n\nThe researchers performed genetic testing on the fungal samples to trace the history and spread of powdery mildew disease. Interestingly, none of the old specimens have the same genetic makeup, or genotype, as the specimens currently spreading throughout the world.\n\nThe study showed that the disease originated in the eastern United States and was set loose globally in two different introductions. One strain of E. vaccinii found its way to China, Mexico and California, while a different strain wound up in Morocco, Peru and Portugal. Bradshaw thinks humans are responsible for the spread as nursery plants traveled to foreign shores.\n\n\"This is a hard organism to control,\" Bradshaw said. \"If you're sending plant material across the world, you're likely spreading this fungus with it.\"\n\nInterestingly, the study also showed that the E. vaccinii fungus found in blueberries in other countries appears to solely reproduce asexually; both sexual versions of the fungus are not required in reproduction, whereas the fungus reproduces sexually and asexually in the United States.\n\nThe study also worked with a large company and farmers to provide an estimate of the global cost of powdery mildew to blueberries, reflecting the cost of spraying fungicide to prevent or reduce powdery mildew. The study estimates a cost range of between $47 million and $530 million annually to the global blueberry industry.\n\nFinally, the study provides some early warning signals to important blueberry producing areas, like the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Conditions there are ripe for powdery mildew to take hold and spread, but the disease has not found its way there yet.\n\n\"Disease spread could also be impacted by agricultural conditions,\" Bradshaw said. \"Some areas that grow blueberries in tunnels, or enclosed areas, seem to have worse disease outcomes than areas that grow blueberries outdoors without any covering, like in North Carolina.\"\n\nBradshaw added that the researchers utilized a useful tool that can help identify E. vaccinii strains to aid farmers and other researchers.\n\n\"It's difficult to identify the fungus that causes powdery mildew in blueberries, so we input our data in a public database developed at NC State by a co-author, Ignazio Carbone. This platform allows growers to enter their data and learn which specific strain is in their fields,\" Bradshaw said. \"That's important because understanding the genetics can warn farmers about which strain they have, whether it is resistant to fungicides, and how the disease is spreading, as well as the virulence of particular strains.\"","source":{"uri":"technologynetworks.com","dataType":"news","title":"Technology Networks"},"authors":[],"image":"https://assets.technologynetworks.com/production/dynamic/images/content/394808/powdery-mildew-has-spread-from-eastern-us-to-multiple-continents-in-last-decade-394808-640x360.jpg?cb=20250109","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.1529411764705881,"wgt":474111018,"relevance":18},{"uri":"8492408957","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"09:26:36","dateTime":"2025-01-09T09:26:36Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T09:26:01Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://kashmirobserver.net/2025/01/09/climate-change-to-cut-wheat-rice-yields-by-up-to-10-warn-officials/","title":"Climate Change To Cut Wheat, Rice Yields By Up To 10%, Warn Officials","body":"New Delhi- India's rice and wheat output is projected to dip by 6-10 per cent due to climate change, impacting access to affordable food for millions, senior officials have said.\n\nAnother effect of climate change is that sea water is becoming warmer along the coast forcing fish to move away to cooler water in deep sea, which has also hit the fishing community, the officials said.\n\nIndia's wheat production had touched 113.29 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year, which was about 14 per cent of the global output, while rice harvests topped 137 million tonnes.

Syria will fall apart in accordance with its ethnic and religious structure...\" -- Oded Yinon, A Strategy for Israel in the Nineteen Eighties, voltairenet\n\nIsraeli military forces have moved to within 15 miles of the Syrian Capital of Damascus. The IDF has seized large tracts of land in southern Syria it intends to occupy and where it will eventually build checkpoints, military outposts and settlements. The \"lightening\" invasion has been accompanied by a massive bombing campaign that has obliterated numerous military bases, weapons depots and research labs eliminating any hope that Syria will regain the ability to defend itself or to reestablish its sovereign independence. For all practical purposes, Syria no longer exists; the persistent attacks of foreign enemies have left the country vanquished and splintered. The carve-up of the critically located nation-state has already begun.\n\nAt the same time the IDF is closing in on Damascus, US Forces along the Turkish border have started building a military base in the city of Kobani. The move is intended to provoke Turkey into a confrontation that will pit Washington's Kurdish proxy militia against the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The situation is fraught with danger as it increases the likelihood that two NATO members will soon clash in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe United States is reportedly building a military base to help its ally the YPG, the Syrian offshoot of the PKK terrorist group, in northern Syria where the terrorists have been cornered by the Türkiye-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) since the fall of Bashar Assad's regime.\n\nLocal journalists said 13 trucks with U.S. flags and carrying concrete construction blocks arrived in the PKK/YPG's stronghold Ain al-Arab, also known as Kobani, early on Thursday morning. The U.S. military has emptied a base in neighboring Iraq and the concrete blocks and other materials are being shipped to Ain al-Arab for a Syrian base, according to local sources. Earlier this week, the U.S. military transferred dozens of Bradley armored vehicles to the region and supplied air defense systems and other armored vehicles to the YPG....\n\nThe PKK is proscribed as a terrorist group by the European Union, the U.S. and Türkiye. It is responsible for more than 40,000 deaths in Türkiye, including women and children. It maintains strongholds in northern Iraq and Syria to create a self-styled \"Kurdish state.\"\n\nThe U.S. has dispatched troops along with military equipment and weapons to Syria's northeast during the Syrian civil war to help the PKK/YPG under the pretext of the fight against Daesh. Ankara says the YPG/PKK is on par with Daesh and should have no presence in the new Syria. US said to set up military base in Syria as SNA corners PKK/YPG, Daily Sabah\n\nThe excerpt above helps to show just how tense the situation in Syria is at the present time. While Washington applauded Turkey's support for the jihadists who just toppled Assad and seized power in Damascus, the Biden administration is deliberately provoking President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on a critical matter of national security. (Turkish leaders regard US support for the Kurds (YPG) as a threat to their security.) This duplicitous behavior is not uncommon for the US which operates on the theory that allies are only allies for as long as they serve Washington's overall interests.\n\nThe US will continue to support the Kurds (aka -- The Syrian Democratic Forces or SDF) in order to preserve access to Syrian oil in the East, and to further reinforce its support for Israeli policy in the region. Israel's affection for the Kurds is purely pragmatic as this excerpt from an article at CNN explains:\n\n...there is one regional power that has thrown its weight behind the Kurds' drive for independence: Israel....Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement ahead of the referendum saying Israel \"supports the legitimate efforts of the Kurdish people to attain a state of its own.\"... \"Israel would welcome another state in the region that shares its concerns about the rising power of Iran, including the threat of Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq,\" says Frantzman. \"Reports have also indicated that oil from Kurdistan is purchased by Israel.\" CNN\n\nSo, aside from getting cheap oil from Kurdish-controlled area in east Syria, Israel also sees the Kurds as a natural ally in their fight against Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria, all of whom oppose an independent Kurdish state. Here's more background from an article at Al-Monitor:\n\nThe Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria has signed an agreement with an American oil company... One of the sources said the agreement to market oil in territory controlled by the US-backed entity and to develop and modernize existing fields was inked last week \"with the knowledge and encouragement of the White House.\".....\n\nOil is the autonomous administration's principal source of income.... The Kurdish-led entity controls most of Syria's oil wealth, which is concentrated in and around the Rmelain fields close to the Turkish and Iraqi borders and in the Al-Omar fields further south.\n\nAnkara is every bit as sensitive about the oil as it's seen as the vehicle for cementing the Syrian Kurds' self-rule project.Turkey has since 2016 been launching military operations against the SDF to disrupt its perceived attempts to establish a contiguous zone of control from the Iraqi border all the way to Afrin to the west of the Euphrates river and beyond. Turkey claims the SDF and its affiliates are \"terrorists\" because of their links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, the rebel group that has been fighting for Kurdish self rule inside Turkey since 1984 and is on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations.\n\nSources told Al-Monitor the agreement to market oil in territory controlled by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces was signed \"with the knowledge and encouragement of the White House.\" Al-Monitor: US oil company signs deal with Syrian Kurd, justiceforkurds.org\n\nSome readers may recall that President Donald Trump boasted many times how he \"took the oil\" in Syria. Here's what he said:\n\nI left troops to take the oil. I took the oil. The only troops I have are taking the oil. They're protecting the oil. I took over the oil... We have the oil. Right now, the U.S. has the oil.\n\nBottom line: Washington's support for the Kurds (aka- the SDF) has allowed a US proxy to control both the oil-rich parts of Syria as well as Syria's breadbasket where most of its wheat is harvested. This loss of revenue -- along with onerous US economic sanctions -- pushed the country into bankruptcy which greatly accelerated the collapse of the state and the removal of Assad. This was a big \"win\" for the US, Turkey, Qatar and other western allies, but mostly for Israel upon whose regional aspirations the overall strategy is based. Keep in mind, that everything that has taken place aligns closely with a strategic blueprint produced by a Zionist intellectual (Oded Yinon) more than four decades ago who concocted \"an accurate and detailed plan....for the Middle East which is based on the division of the whole area into small states, and the dissolution of all the existing Arab states.\" According to political analyst Khalil Nakhleh:\n\n2) must affect the division of the whole area into small states by the dissolution of all existing Arab states.\n\nSmall here will depend on the ethnic or sectarian composition of each state.... Consequently, the Zionist hope is that sectarian-based states become Israel's satellites and, ironically, its source of moral legitimation...What they want and what they are planning for is not an Arab world, but a world of Arab fragments that is ready to succumb to Israeli hegemony...\n\nEvery Arab state.... is a real target sooner or later ...\n\nThere is no indication that Arab strategists have internalized the Zionist plan in its full ramifications. Instead, they react with incredulity and shock whenever a new stage of it unfolds.... The sad fact is that as long as the Zionist strategy for the Middle East is not taken seriously Arab reaction to any future siege of other Arab capitals will be the same. Khalil Nakhleh, The Zionist Plan for the Middle East, powerbase.info\n\nA rehash of these same ideas emerged more than a decade later under the title of \"A Clean Break: A Strategy for Securing the Realm,\" authored by neocon Richard Perle who outlined Israel's strategic vision for remaking the Middle East. Here's a clip:\n\nIsrael can shape its strategic environment, in cooperation with Turkey and Jordan, by weakening, containing, and even rolling back Syria. This effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq - an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right - as a means of foiling Syria's regional ambitions.\"\n\n\"Most important, it is understandable that Israel has an interest supporting diplomatically, militarily and operationally Turkey's and Jordan's actions against Syria, such as securing tribal alliances with Arab tribes that cross into Syrian territory and are hostile to the Syrian ruling elite.\" US Caught Faking It in Syria - fulfilling the Yinon and Clean Break Plans, cnionline.org\n\nThe similarities between the two documents are obvious, as is the fact that this is the operational strategy that is shaping events in the Middle East. The role of vital resources, pipeline corridors and even regional security are all secondary to Israel's ambitious plan for regional hegemony which is the primary impetus for the escalating conflagration. Having eliminated six of seven rivals in the last two decades, we should expect that a war with Iran is now unavoidable. Iran remains the last obstacle to the realization of the Zionist dream which is to become a world power via regional domination.\n\nIt's worth noting, that even though Israel is within striking distance of Damascus, it does not intend to invade or occupy the city. As one astute analyst on Twitter put it:\n\nIsrael had a standing policy never to attempt capturing an Arab capital city. The repercussions of such an act far exceed the propaganda value. That's why Israel never attempted to get to Damascus, or Cairo, during the 1973 war....\n\nThe only time Israel strayed from this policy was in 1982 when the IDF entered the suburbs of Beirut. That was a dumb move and ended badly for the war goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the Israeli leadership will probably remain on the outskirts of the city and avoid the urban warfare that would ensue if they attempted to occupy Damascus itself. That way the IDF can continue its relentless airstrikes on targets within Damascus without engaging in endless door-to-door fighting that would send casualties soaring. In any event, there is currently no sign that the IDF plans to march on Damascus.\n\nOn Friday, Syria's new leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, (aka -- Ahmad al-Sharaa) \"demanded that the United States tell Israel to pull its forces out of the border buffer zone and the Syrian side of Mount Hermon.\"\n\nAccording to an article in Israel Today:\n\nAhmed al-Sharaa, head of Syria's Sunni Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group and the country's de facto leader, has asked the United States to pressure Israel to withdraw from the Golan buffer zone and the peak of Mount Hermon....\n\nSources in Israel said that they did not receive any demand from Washington with regard to Syria, adding that the Jewish state will not compromise on its security, according to the report...\n\nIsrael's \"excuses have run out, and they have crossed the lines of engagement\" for striking the Assad regime's military infrastructure, as well as for deploying troops to several demilitarized zones in the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, The New York Times quoted al-Sharaa as saying. Israel Today\n\nThe excerpt above is the first indication that all-is-not-well between Tel Aviv and its jihadist assets in Damascus. The question is whether this rift will grow now that Assad has been toppled, and Israel no longer needs the assistance of Sunni extremists to advance its regional agenda.\n\nLess than 24 hours after al-Jolani delivered his demands, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar issued the following comment:\n\n\"The world is talking about 'an orderly change of government in Syria.... But it's not like a new government that today controls all of Syria was democratically elected.\n\n\"This is a terrorist gang that was previously in Idlib and took over the capital Damascus and other areas. The world would very much like to see them as a new and stable government because the countries want to return the refugees on their territory to Syria. But that's not the case.\"....\n\nWe can only wonder if there is a link between al-Jolani's assertive approach to Israel's military offensive (and bombing) and the Israeli Foreign Minister's sharp rebuke? The reason this interests us is because we don't believe that a government comprised of Sunni militants will be the compliant puppets that both Israel and the US expect. We think there will be irreconcilable differences that will provoke a stronger response from Israel. That, in turn, will force Erdogan to abandon the pretense that HTS operates independently as he will need to fortify the jihadist positions in southern Syria with brigades from the Turkish Army. In short, where the IDF meets HTS militants represents the de facto border between Israel and Turkey. This will become more apparent as the various players reinforce their defensive positions and \"dig in.\" Check out this excerpt from an article at The Jerusalem Post:\n\nThe tumultuous relationship between Israel and Turkey is heading for more turbulence as recent developments in Syria pit the two countries against each other in what has the potential of developing into a direct armed confrontation....\n\nTurkey has been at odds with Israel in the past, during previous confrontations it has had with Hamas. This time was different.... Turkey is looking to cement further its influence in Syria, which shares a border with Israel. For years, despite being officially at war, the border was one of Israel's quietest. Now, as Turkey inches closer to Israel geographically, this quiet could be interrupted.\n\n\"There is a chance of a future military confrontation between Israel and Turkey,\" Prof. Efrat Aviv, an expert on Turkey from Bar-Ilan's Department of General History and Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, told The Media Line. \"This is unprecedented, as are all events witnessed in the region recently.\"...\n\nRelations between Israel and Turkey have been sour for over a decade, although the two maintained diplomatic and trade relations throughout several crises. Now, Turkey is at Israel's doorstep, and with a less than cordial relationship, tensions regarding Syria could lead to a deterioration....\n\nThe latest developments in Syria, which have essentially left the country up for grabs, have Turkey and Israel both putting boots on the ground, each in different areas.\n\n\"Turkey is very adamant about its interests in Syria, and Erdogan wants to cement his influence there, aiming for the new government there to be under his sponsorship,\" said Aviv. \"This includes massive investment, including in Kurdish areas, in order for the Syrian society to be pro-Turkish. Turkey wants to completely quash Kurdish independence aspirations.\"...\n\n\"As long as Erdogan is in power, nothing good will happen in the relationship, and it will only get worse. Even if he is replaced by a regime less critical of Israel, it will take time for the criticism towards Israel to decline,\" said Aviv. \"Turkish society will take time to change its toxic public opinion towards Israel as anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist sentiment in Turkey is very strong.\" Erdogan's policies in Syria bring Turkey and Israel closer to confrontation, Jerusalem Post\n\nIsrael does not have the manpower or resources to engage Turkey in open battle, so the logical option would be to persuade Washington to do its dirty work for it by inciting hostilities in the north, thereby dragging the US into another forever war aimed at advancing the malign Zionist agenda. (Building a military base in Kobani achieves this objective. It is a clear provocation.)\n\nIt seems fitting that the three most war-mongering nations in the world today -- Israel, Turkey and the US -- would wind up on a battlefield at the center of the Middle East where their aggressive, competing agendas are destined to clash in one last bloody conflagration. Is there any way to stop this train wreck?\n\nMichael Whitney is a renowned geopolitical and social analyst based in Washington State.

Authorities seized milk products and frozen meats, sparking nationwide backlash and seeding an unprecedented wave of pro-Donald Trump Amish votes among an agricultural community known for keeping to themselves.\n\nThe arcane legal posture of the case arises from the delicate state and federal boundaries of the US Constitution and resulted in a strange preliminary injunction whereby Miller and his affiliated businesses are free to sell raw milk and other uninspected food products to people in other states but not within the state of Pennsylvania. The decision hinges upon the state's balancing test for injunctions.\n\nAfter seizing the Millers' food products and filing a 357-page complaint, the State of Pennsylvania requested a preliminary injunction prohibiting the farm family from selling any raw milk pending the trial's outcome. The trial court initially granted the state's request but later amended its ruling to permit Miller and his wife Rebecca to sell raw milk outside the state's boundaries (but not within) because of concerns that important constitutional rights were impacted.\n\nThe Millers argued an injunction prohibiting sales to customers outside Pennsylvania would violate the Supremacy Clause, the Commerce Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Right to Travel Clause of the US Constitution. The trial court agreed, fashioning its Solomonic injunction because it \"decline[d] to blur the line between the regulation of raw milk sales in the Commonwealth and interstate commerce.\"\n\nHistorically, the federal government is empowered by the US Constitution and the Supremacy Clause to regulate interstate commerce, including the sale of food. State governments retain authority to oversee the health and safety of food products and other commerce within state boundaries. The Pennsylvania raw milk statute even employs the phrase \"within the Commonwealth,\" and so the trial court limited the injunction to that jurisdictional (and geographical) demarcation pending a fuller consideration of the facts and law at trial.\n\nThe case does not address the safety of raw milk, which is legal in Pennsylvania, so long as a permit is obtained, which Miller asserts violates his religious liberties. Famous for their devout, humble lifestyles and stubborn resilience, the Pennsylvania Amish are also renowned for carving a protective constitutional \"safe space\" around their religious observances. In the seminal 1972 case of Wisconsin v. Yoder, the Amish won recognition of the liberty to withdraw their children from compulsory public school education past the eighth grade. The US Supreme Court ruled their fundamental rights to the free exercise of their faith outweighed the state's interest in educating their children.\n\nThat precedent bears an interesting parallel to Miller's current kerfuffle. In its Jan. 3, 2025, ruling, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania balanced the potential economic harms to the Millers' farming business against the state's arguments of threats to public safety in determining whether a preliminary injunction should be issued. Agreeing with the lower court that important federal constitutional issues are raised that must be addressed at trial, the appellate court emphasized the Millers' arguments alleging irrevocable harm:\n\n\"The Millers argue a preliminary injunction of their out-of-state raw milk sales would bankrupt them, cause them to lose their family farm, and effectively end the case before the trial court can decide the merits ... On this issue, we find persuasive Watson v. Perdue, 410 F. Supp. 3d 122, 131 (D.D.C. 2019), recognizing loss of a family farm constitutes irreparable harm because '[i]t involves the loss of generations of family history, sweat-equity, and memories,' and monetary damages are no substitute ... The Department does not dispute a preliminary injunction would bankrupt the Millers, and it presented no evidence to the contrary during the evidentiary hearing.\"\n\nThis is uncharted legal territory, though, for all American farmers and consumers. The infamous 1942 case of Wickard v. Filburn held that the federal government possessed the constitutional power to regulate a farmer's wheat grown in his own fields and fed to his own livestock under the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution. Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture v. Miller is grappling with the issue of whether one state can regulate the commerce of another.\n\nEach side argues the other's position is absurd: The state asserts restricting its authority would allow people from other states to come there to produce uninspected goods to sell outside of Pennsylvania. The Millers posit that permitting the state's interpretation would allow it to interfere with people traveling through the Commonwealth in possession of raw milk intended for other states, interfering with federal jurisdiction and federal rights to freedom of travel.\n\nMiller will continue selling raw milk in other states pending his ongoing Pennsylvania court battles. If he prevails at trial, and the federal government declines to intrude between him and his trusting customers, he might keep selling uninspected raw milk out-of-state long after his cows come home.","source":{"uri":"libertynation.com","dataType":"news","title":"Liberty Nation"},"authors":[{"uri":"john_klar@libertynation.com","name":"John Klar","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://www.libertynation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1135992402-Amish.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.1607843137254902,"wgt":474110670,"relevance":9},{"uri":"8492403309","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"09:22:59","dateTime":"2025-01-09T09:22:59Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T09:22:13Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.newsdrum.in/national/climate-change-to-cut-wheat-rice-yields-by-up-to-10-percent-warn-officials-8604517","title":"Climate change to cut wheat, rice yields by up to 10 percent, warn officials","body":"New Delhi, Jan 9 (PTI) India's rice and wheat output is projected to dip by 6-10 per cent due to climate change, impacting access to affordable food for millions, senior officials have said.\n\nAnother effect of climate change is that sea water is becoming warmer along the coast forcing fish to move away to cooler water in deep sea, which has also hit the fishing community, the officials said.\n\nIndia's wheat production had touched 113.29 million tonnes in the 2023-24 crop year, which was about 14 per cent of the global output, while rice harvests topped 137 million tonnes.

Much of it is now not even worth cattle feed.\n\nThis, in a country that ranks 105 on Global Hunger Index (far below countries like Ethiopia) and in a state where over 26% of kids under 5 are underweight -- the worst in the country, as per a reply in Lok Sabha.\n\nMP state civil supplies corporation, which ensures distribution of foodgrains through public distribution system, had to issue tenders to sell these rotten foodgrains so that at least some portion of the cost is recovered. Over 90% of it is wheat.\n\nSuch tenders were issued at least four times in 2024, between March 13 and Nov 5. The corporation sold around 8.9 lakh quintals of foodgrains this way, excluding some stale rice that too was sold in small quantities.\n\nAsked about this, minister for food and civil supplies, Govind Singh Rajput told TOI, \"It is an old matter, which has come to my notice only now. I have instructed officials that there should be no such recurrence. I have also ordered that insurance companies should be roped in to cover such things. We are framing a new insurance policy that includes coverage for such scenarios. In the meantime I have also instructed that inspections should be carried out from time to time and strict action should be taken against those who are responsible.\"\n\n\"How much govt lost by selling these stale foodgrains depends on several factors, like the year in which it was procured, the cost of procurement that year, storage cost, transportation cost and the category under which it was sold. Overall, rough estimates say these 9 lakh quintals will lead to a loss of around Rs 200 crore,\" said a source.\n\nAsked for his comment on the issue, managing director of civil supplies corporation, Pratap Narayan Yadav said, \"Whatever the difference between revenue generated from sale of these foodgrains and cost incurred, will be recovered from the payables of the state warehousing and logistics corporation.\"\n\nThe rotten foodgrains that were sold were divided into five categories: feed I, feed II, (both considered fit for cattle feed), feed III (for poultry feed), industrial and manure use (not even fit for cattle or poultry) and manure category (not even fit for any industrial use).\n\nThese foodgrains are not only from recent years but as far back as 2018-19. Foodgrains were getting spoiled, and fare for storage was also piling up, so a drive was initiated to clear such stocks and clean the books, a source said.\n\nFoodgrains are procured from farmers through co-operative societies, and then transported to warehouses run by state warehousing and logistics corporation. The transportation costs, fare for storage, and commission for procurement is paid by civil supplies corporation.\n\nMD of MP warehousing and logistics corporation Sibi Chakravorty couldn't be contacted as he is on leave. An official of the corporation, requesting anonymity, said, \"If the warehouse is in a joint venture, then losses are recovered from the owners. If it is govt-owned, then recovery is done from employees. It is the responsibility of civil supplies corporation to pick up the foodgrains on time. If they fail to do so, the grains get damaged.\"\n\nTo put the loss of 9 lakh quintals of foodgrains in perspective, wheat allotment for the entire state in Jan 2025 is around 11 lakh quintals. As per a reply in Lok Sabha last year, as of Oct 2023, 26.5% children in Madhya Pradesh aged below 5 years were underweight -- this was highest in the country.","source":{"uri":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","dataType":"news","title":"The Times of India"},"authors":[{"uri":"amarjeet_singh@timesofindia.indiatimes.com","name":"Amarjeet Singh","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117069222,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-190100,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.1764705882352942,"wgt":474110036,"relevance":58},{"uri":"b-8492375003","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"09:09:56","dateTime":"2025-01-09T09:09:56Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T09:03:50Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://oanow.com/the-great-drone-debate/article_279b5d7d-0ced-5340-a337-c5bcd96bb7ca.html","title":"THE GREAT DRONE DEBATE","body":"DIDI TANG\n\nAssociated Press\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nThe economic and technological rivalry between the United States and China has come to the drone market, where Chinese-made flying devices are a dominant player.\n\nU.S. lawmakers seek to ban new sales of drones from two dominant Chinese manufacturers, arguing they could be used to spy on Americans and that the low-cost models are hurting the U.S. drone industry.\n\nThe defense bill that Congress passed in late December would bar new Chinese drones from DJI Technology and Autel Robotics should a review find them to pose an \"unacceptable\" risk to U.S. national security.\n\nBut American users, from police officers to farmers, mappers and filmmakers, have come to rely on Chinese-made drones, especially those by DJI.\n\nHere are some things to know about the drone debate.\n\nPeople are also reading...

While the waiver was initially aimed at curbing food inflation, critics argue it poses significant economic risks.\n\nA source speaking anonymously to The Punch stated, \"Many media outlets have been criticizing the government for not fully implementing the food import waiver. However, the government is taking a cautious approach to protect local industries. Groups like the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) have strongly opposed the measure, emphasizing the need to focus on boosting local production instead.\"\n\nAnother insider revealed that members of the Organized Private Sector have argued that food importation will devastate local companies and lead to job losses.\n\nSegun Kuti-George, National Vice President of the Nigerian Association of Small-Scale Industrialists, described the policy as a \"double-edged sword.\" He stated, \"Every policy has pros and cons. The key is to weigh the advantages against the disadvantages before implementation. We must carefully assess whether the benefits outweigh the risks.\"\n\nAnnounced by Agriculture Minister Abubakar Kyari on July 10, 2024, the waiver suspended duties, tariffs, and taxes on imports of maize, husked brown rice, wheat, and cowpeas for 150 days.\n\nThe policy aimed to address food inflation caused by high prices and limited availability. As part of the initiative, the government also planned to import 250,000 metric tonnes of wheat and maize for distribution to small-scale processors and millers.\n\nHowever, implementation has stalled, leaving many Nigerians to struggle with rising food prices. The Nigeria Customs Service estimated that the waiver could result in a ₦188.37 billion revenue loss over six months. Additionally, eligibility criteria requiring beneficiary companies to be at least five years old and registered in Nigeria have further complicated execution.\n\nCritics, including business advocates and economists, view the policy's non-implementation as a sign of inefficiency and inconsistency in governance.\n\nFemi Egbesola, President of the Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, criticized the lack of coordination among government agencies, stating, \"The blame game among the Nigeria Customs Service and the Federal Ministry of Finance over non-implementation is a clear sign of disarray. Governments should prioritize addressing food deficits through short-term imports while planning medium- and long-term solutions to support local agriculture.\"\n\nEconomist and sustainability expert Marcel Okeke warned about the policy's potential to harm local producers. He stated, \"Allowing imports risks pricing local producers out of the market, just as we saw with the decline of the textile industry when the government opened up to imports. This could discourage domestic production and lead to an influx of substandard imports.\"\n\nOkeke emphasized the importance of self-reliance, urging the government to focus on supporting local producers. \"The best approach is to grow our capacity organically, encouraging local producers to meet our needs while using imports only as a supplement,\" he added.\n\nFinance Minister Wale Edun acknowledged the concerns and assured stakeholders that the policy is under review. \"We are addressing emerging issues to ensure the policy does not undermine domestic food production capacity,\" he stated.\n\nAs the debate continues, stakeholders remain divided on whether the policy's benefits outweigh its potential risks to the Nigerian economy.","source":{"uri":"gistreel.com","dataType":"news","title":"GistReel"},"authors":[{"uri":"jay_malik@gistreel.com","name":"Jay Malik","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://www.gistreel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-2024-11-19T113107.099.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.2235294117647059,"wgt":474108800,"relevance":55},{"uri":"8492357122","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"08:52:42","dateTime":"2025-01-09T08:52:42Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T08:50:48Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://dnyuz.com/2025/01/09/egypts-economy-is-damaged-it-sees-a-scapegoat-and-a-potential-fix-in-refugees/","title":"Egypt's Economy Is Damaged. It Sees a Scapegoat, and a Potential Fix, in Refugees.","body":"In easier times for Egypt's refugees, Azza Mostafa, a pro-government TV anchor, had nothing but generous words for the many thousands of Syrians who had built new lives in Egypt after their own country imploded into civil war in 2011.\n\n\"I'd like to say to our Syrian families and our brothers in Egypt,\" she said in a 2019 broadcast, \"you've truly brought light to Egypt.\"\n\nBut there she was on her show in June, fulminating against Egypt's growing number of outsiders -- an echo of the country's leaders, whose policy toward refugees and migrants has hardened as they wrestle with an economic crisis made worse by wars in neighboring Gaza, Sudan and Libya.\n\n\"This has become unbearable,\" Ms. Mostafa said, accusing migrants of driving up rents and promoting female genital mutilation. \"There are many acts of overstepping bounds. Is that acceptable? After we opened our country for them?\"\n\nEgypt long made it easy for foreigners of all kinds to live and work in the country, largely without interference, whether they were refugees, migrant workers or Westerners escaping coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nThe past 13 years have brought a near unbroken stream of newcomers fleeing conflict to the country that is known among Arabs as the \"mother of the world.\" That includes not just Syrians but also Sudanese, Yemenis, Eritreans and, most recently, Palestinians from Gaza.\n\nEgypt's lax immigration rules meant many never formally registered as refugees or received official permission to stay long-term, yet managed to stitch themselves almost seamlessly into the country, supporting themselves and sometimes starting businesses.\n\nSince Sudan's civil war drove a surge of refugees to Egypt starting in 2023, however, the impoverished government in Cairo has complained louder and louder about the burden of foreigners. It rapidly tightened its policies -- hoping, analysts and diplomats say, to win more support from international backers eager to prevent migration to their own countries.\n\nEgypt says it spends $10 billion each year on its nine million refugees, according to officials and government-controlled media (though experts say both numbers are greatly exaggerated), all while Egyptians endure soaring prices and subsidy cuts.\n\nYears of government overspending, reliance on imports and policies that neglected private-sector growth left the country's finances in precarious shape before the wars in Ukraine and Gaza sent them crashing. Egypt lost $7 billion in crucial revenue from the Suez Canal in 2024 as the conflict in Gaza has squeezed shipping in the Red Sea, according to government officials.\n\nWith Egypt deep in debt and hard-pressed to pay for imports such as wheat and energy, the currency has crashed, while some goods have become difficult to find.\n\nAhmed Abu Al-Yazid, the head of a government-owned sugar firm, the Delta Sugar Company, blamed refugees for a sugar shortage that experts link to the economic crisis. The president accused them of draining Egypt's precious water. On social media, pro-government accounts -- some of which appeared to be fake -- accused Sudanese refugees of driving up rents and promoting female genital mutilation.\n\nA crackdown soon followed the accusations, according to migrants, refugees and their advocates.\n\nSudanese refugees have been rounded up in police sweeps, detained and summarily deported. Syrians who have lived in Egypt for years have been told to pay thousands of dollars to stay. Many remain hesitant to return, despite the fall of the Assad regime in December, until the situation stabilizes.\n\nForeign workers from Asia and from other parts of Africa now face extra hurdles to keep their legal status, and in some cases, have been arrested to compel them to pay high fees, advocates say.\n\nLast month, Egypt passed a law that would hand responsibility for screening refugees and others to the government, instead of to the United Nations refugee agency.\n\nGovernment officials said the measure would ensure a wide array of refugee rights. Critics of the move, however, said that it would become far harder for refugees to gain protection or access to health care and schools. The law also empowers the government to revoke refugee status on vague grounds such as breaches of national security, political activity or violations of Egyptian social customs.\n\nAbu Saleh, 32, a Syrian who works in a small Cairo grocery, said he had lived in the city for 13 years \"without a single issue\" until he discovered in July that he could no longer enroll his son in school without a residence permit.\n\nJust to renew his family's tourist visas, he said, he was told that he would have to return to Syria and pay $2,000 per person in fees -- a process he would have to repeat every six months.\n\n\"Egypt has been there for us all along,\" said Abu Saleh, who asked to be identified by the name he uses around town to avoid possible repercussions. \"I'd like to appeal to the government of Egypt: Give us residence, even if it's a little more expensive. We're facing tough conditions.\"\n\nEgypt has not explained its hardening attitude toward foreigners. But analysts and migrant advocates tie it to the economic crisis, which has generated widespread bitterness and undermined President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's rule.\n\nThe newcomers make convenient scapegoats for Egyptians' hardships, rights groups say. Immigration fees, charged in dollars, can supply some of the foreign currency that Egypt badly needs. And foreigners are also valuable pawns in Egypt's quest for more financial support from its international partners, rights groups say.\n\n\"They think, 'How can these people be useful for the government?'\" said Nour Khalil, executive director of the Refugees Platform in Egypt, which advocates for migrants' rights.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency counts about 818,000 registered refugees in Egypt, who are entitled to free public health care and education. There are likely many more unregistered refugees, though analysts and aid workers dispute the figure reaches nine million.\n\nThe benefits that registered refugees receive mean that Egypt \"is treating them like Egyptians, despite the fact that we are not a rich country,\" the foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said at a news conference last month. \"There is no country in the world assuming these responsibilities and challenges like here in Egypt. We don't have one single refugee camp -- they are fully integrated in society.\"\n\nRefugee advocates agree that Egypt needs more resources. Unlike other countries in the region, including Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, where the United States, the United Nations and the European Union have poured billions into supporting refugees, Egypt has not received significant funds to help house Syrian or other refugees.\n\nThat is changing.\n\nAs the war in Gaza has pounded Egypt's finances, Western backers have rushed to Egypt's aid, anxious to prevent an economic collapse in the Arab world's most populous country, analysts and diplomats say. A crash in Egypt could further destabilize the Middle East and send a deluge of migrants across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, where there is heavy public pressure to restrict migration.\n\nThe European Union pledged a fast-tracked $8 billion aid package to Egypt in March, echoing deals the bloc has struck with Mauritania, Tunisia and Turkey that funded migration enforcement in those countries.\n\nOther backers, including the International Monetary Fund, have sent billions more to stabilize Egypt's economy.\n\nCritics say the European pact with Egypt, like the bloc's other migration deals, is enabling rights abuses by rewarding Mr. el-Sisi's authoritarianism and potentially funding the current crackdown on migrants.\n\nGroups including Amnesty International and the Refugees Platform in Egypt have documented what they say is a pattern of mass arbitrary arrests and unlawful deportations of Sudanese refugees -- some detained as they were smuggled across the border, others rounded up during random sweeps of predominantly Sudanese neighborhoods.\n\nSome Syrians, too, have been expelled, Mr. Khalil of the refugees platform said. His group has also documented more than 50 arrests of foreign workers, some of whom already had residency, who were held until they paid $1,000 in fees and fines, he said.\n\nAn atmosphere of fear has brought throngs of Sudanese to the doorstep of the U.N. refugee agency in Cairo, seeking formal protection. But refugee status can take months, if not years, to obtain: Appointments to begin the process are not available until late 2025. And some of the Sudanese who have been detained and deported, Mr. Khalil said, held some form of U.N. identification, casting doubt on whether the organization could guarantee security.\n\nAmong those waiting outside one morning was Mohammed Abdelwahab, 36. By the time he and his family tried to cross the border from Sudan this spring, Egypt had tightly restricted what had been free-flowing movement between the two countries, so they resorted to smugglers instead.\n\nWithout legal papers, Mr. Abdelwahab and his 14-year-old son, Mohanad, collected plastic bottles on Cairo's streets for a living. Mr. Abdelwahab was looking for better work one day in June when Mohanad disappeared.\n\nTwenty days later, Mohanad resurfaced with a WhatsApp message: He had been rounded up with a group of other Sudanese and deported.\n\nMr. Abdelwahab had been looking for Mohanad in another city. When he returned to Cairo, his wife and three other children had been evicted for nonpayment.\n\n\"It's indescribable,\" he said. \"Now they're all camping out here,\" he added, referring to his family and indicating the sidewalk in front of the refugee agency, where groups of other Sudanese waited listlessly in the sun.","source":{"uri":"dnyuz.com","dataType":"news","title":"DNyuz"},"authors":[],"image":"https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Egypts-Economy-Is-Damaged-It-Sees-a-Scapegoat-and-a.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.03529411764705881,"wgt":474108762,"relevance":15},{"uri":"8492355058","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"08:50:25","dateTime":"2025-01-09T08:50:25Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T08:49:42Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.8392156958580017,"url":"https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/martin-lewis-moneysavingexpert-shares-1p-30738161","title":"Martin Lewis' MoneySavingExpert shares 1p-an-hour items to keep warm","body":"Experts are sounding the alarm for UK residents to implement cost-effective measures to stay safe and warm during the cold winter months without breaking the bank. This advice is growing increasingly vital as households across the nation are hit with substantial energy price increases, including a 1.2 percent rise in costs from January 1.\n\nThe website MoneySavingExpert (MSE), founded by financial guru Martin Lewis, proposes a novel approach amidst soaring prices: \"Heating the human not the home.\" Addressing the urgent need for this kind of guidance, Martin Lewis said: \"This is a guide I really wish we needn't be publishing.\"\n\nHe went on: \"The reason I asked Sarah and the team to put this together is due to my overflowing email bag of desperation from people who can't afford their energy bills. So don't see this as a 'MSE or Martin says you should do this'.\n\n\"It's more that we're trying to help provide some options and information for those that may need to drastically cut down on energy usage due to financial desperation and some help for others who may want to do it out of a commitment to green issues.\"\n\nIn line with this objective, MSE has issued a useful guide for individuals seeking to keep themselves cosy without sending their energy costs sky-high. The guide lists various economical devices such as electric throws, warming pads, and footwarmers designed to offer warmth this winter, reports Bristol Live.\n\nPlymouthLive reported that the MSE website said: \"There are lots of options out there - we can't vouch for which will keep you warmest, but we have tried to work out which is cheapest to run. Generally we found it was those which could be charged via USB, but these items tend to be smaller, and may only warm part of your body (such as hands or feet).\n\n\"It's also worth factoring in the initial cost, if you don't already own one of the items below. We've given a rough price of the cheapest options we found (at Amazon, Dunelm, Superdrug and so on).\n\n\"Of course, the cheapest option may not be the best quality. Do your own research, read reviews before buying and check safety advice before using any of the options below.\"\n\nAt the top of their economical heating suggestions were four USB-powered devices; USB gloves costing £10 with less than 1p per hour running costs, amounting to roughly 4p per week for five hours of daily use. Heated insoles are similarly priced at £10 and share the same operational costs.\n\nA slightly more expensive item at £15, USB hand warmers maintain the economical 1p hourly rate. For keeping the upper body warm, an electric gilet inclusive of a battery is priced around £50, yet it is still economical to run, costing under 1p an hour and about 4p per week.\n\nAdditionally, MSE evaluated several traditional heating products after presenting these innovative suggestions.\n\nA microwaveable wheat bag, which costs around £4 to purchase and less than 1p per hour or 14p per week to heat for 60 seconds, will only stay warm for about 20 to 40 minutes. A standard hot water bottle (1.5 litre) is priced at approximately £5.50 and costs around 4p for one hour or 70p for the week - assuming it's used twice daily.\n\nThe experts also recommended reusable hand warmers that cost £5 for a pair and less than 1p an hour, or £1 a week (if heated on a gas hob) or £3 (electric). They also examined products that need to be plugged into the mains.\n\nAn electric heat pad costs around £20 to buy but 2p to run for an hour and 87p a week. Electric footwarmers and electric blankets also cost the same to run but £25 and £35 to buy respectively.\n\nRegarding electric blankets, they noted that fire brigades generally advise against buying second-hand. Other methods to stay warm as suggested by MSE include:\n\nEat regularly and have at least one hot meal a day Keep your feet warm with rugs and slippers Choose the right socks, and consider changing them during the day Layer clothes to keep in the heat Warm up by moving around.\n\nIf you are struggling to pay your energy bills and need some guidance, visit moneysavingexpert.com/utilities/how-to-get-help-if-you-re-struggling-with-your-energy-bills.","source":{"uri":"cambridge-news.co.uk","dataType":"news","title":"Cambridge News Online"},"authors":[{"uri":"anna_starnes@cambridge-news.co.uk","name":"Anna Starnes","type":"author","isAgency":false},{"uri":"fiona_callingham@cambridge-news.co.uk","name":"Fiona Callingham","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article30699246.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Mother-With-Son-Trying-To-Keep-Warm-By-Radiator-At-Home-During-Cost-Of-Living-Energy-Crisis.jpg","eventUri":"eng-10233974","sentiment":0.2862745098039217,"wgt":474108625,"relevance":12},{"uri":"8492354190","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"08:49:50","dateTime":"2025-01-09T08:49:50Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T08:49:05Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.7450980544090271,"url":"https://www.newkerala.com/news/o/fs-vikram-misri-meets-acting-afghan-fm-affirms-indias-545","title":"India Reaffirms Support for Afghanistan in Dubai Meet","body":"India agreed to promote trade and commerce, including through Chabahar port.

As we step into a new year of 2025, the aquaculture sector, is also experiencing unprecedented advancements through innovation and sustainability measures, to meet the growing demand for sea food that is safe and of high quality.\n\nThe Shrimp sector is the backbone of the India's aquaculture industry. Formulated Shrimp feed is very critical for the growth of this sector, as it directly impacts shrimp health, growth, and farm profitability. As cost of raw materials such as fishmeal, soybean, and wheat flour continue to fluctuate managing these costs while maintaining feed quality is a constant challenge for Shrimp feed formulators. The industry also faces pressure to adopt sustainable practices. The stringent quality and safety standards in both domestic and export markets demand rigorous compliance.\n\nHaving been in the Shrimp sector for more than three decades, Waterbase understands the customer needs better and meets them by implementing a code of good manufacturing practices. We believe that quality and food safety are the cornerstones to the businesses we operate in. We continuously work to improve our products performance through investment in R&D and rigorous testing. We are committed to the promotion & growth of sustainable aquaculture in India through responsible sourcing, eco-friendly practices, innovation, and farmers' education.\n\nThe advancements in Shrimp feed technology have revolutionized shrimp farming over the past decade. In the upcoming years, the importance of high-quality, nutritionally balanced and environmentally sustainable feeds will be more evident than ever, the focus will be on functional feeds that go beyond meeting the energy requirements of shrimp, build disease resistance and boost growth. Incorporating novel ingredients, evaluating alternative protein sources (to reduce dependency on traditional fishmeal) will gain traction. These innovations not only ensure cost-effective solutions for farmers but also promote sustainability. The Shrimp farming is highly susceptible to diseases, functional feeds enriched with novel ingredients, probiotics, prebiotics, and immune-boosting additives will help farmers combat diseases. The advanced research and feed formulations are now tailored to specific shrimp growth stages and environmental conditions. This precision nutrition boosts immunity, ensures optimal feed conversion ratios, reduces wastage and improves farm profitability.\n\nUnfortunately, some shrimp farmers are not aware of the benefits of high-quality functional Shrimp feeds and the importance of sustainable farming practices. Waterbase conducts aqua meets every month, to educate the Shrimp farmers on these topics.\n\nLooking ahead, the mission at The Waterbase Limited is to innovate, collaborate, and drive sustainability. The help of cutting-edge technologies will prioritize environmental stewardship and by putting aquaculture farmers at the center of our strategy, we aim to shape the future of Shrimp aquaculture.\n\nThe growth of aquaculture stands as a testament to the resilience and innovation of the industry. For those of us in shrimp feed manufacturing, this is a time to lead with purpose and vision. By delivering high-quality, sustainable feed solutions, we not only support the growth of aquaculture but also contribute to global food security and economic prosperity. The future of shrimp farming is bright, and we are proud to be at the heart of this transformation.","source":{"uri":"apnnews.com","dataType":"news","title":"apnnews.com"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.apnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Mr.-Ramakanth-Akula-CEO-of-The-Warerbase-Limited-1024x683.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.3176470588235294,"wgt":474108067,"relevance":18},{"uri":"8492338827","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"08:39:18","dateTime":"2025-01-09T08:39:18Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T08:38:13Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.miragenews.com/australian-prime-minister-doorstop-interview-1388427/","title":"Australian Prime Minister Doorstop Interview - Perth 9 January","body":": Welcome everyone.

And it's great also to be here with my friend, the Premier of Western Australia, Roger Cook, on what is my 27th visit to WA as Prime Minister of Australia. We're on target to hit the 30 visits that I committed to. We're also exceeding a target in one area, which is that at the last election campaign we promised 50 Urgent Care Clinics. We now have 87 which are open today. More than a million Australians have got the care that they need when they needed it through Medicare Urgent Care Clinics. Importantly as well, this work has taken pressure off emergency departments. One in four of those people who've gone through clinics have been young people, people under the age of 15. So, that if you have a health issue that is not life threatening, this is the place to come. Which is why so many families have benefited from Medicare Urgent Care Clinics. Here in WA, more than 124,000 visits in WA. And you know what it's cost? Zero. Zero, to every single patient who's come through because all they have needed is their Medicare card, not their credit card. This is a part of a visit to WA of three days. I arrived yesterday afternoon in Kununurra and I want to thank all of those who hosted us there yesterday evening at a community function. And then today we had the significant announcement of $200 million in housing and community infrastructure for regional WA. Making sure that homes can be built by having the infrastructure that's required. Whether that might be connecting up with sewage, connecting up with water, some work, making sure that housing can be facilitated, whether that be social housing or private investment as well. But in addition to that, community infrastructure, importantly, in regional WA, lifting up the quality of life for people throughout our regions. In addition to that, we designated three ports with the status to be able to directly export and import. Now, in just one of those ports close to where we were this morning, Wyndham Port, that is going to be a game changer. We know that the Ord has been really important and we've continued to see an expansion of investment there. But what this represents is a game changer. It means that for the cotton exports that are required, need the empty containers to come in to that port. By having customs facilities directly there, it changes the way that the Kimberley will be able to operate in the future. It is productivity improving, it's job creating and it's economic growth enhancing. That is what this reform that we've done - I've had strong representations from the Premier about this and when I rang Rog about this a couple of days ago, he was more than pleased with this announcement. It's a part of our commitment to make sure that we deliver for Australians no matter where they live. And it's another example of the commitment that we've done working in partnership here in WA, not just with the State Government, led by Roger Cook, but also with the private sector and the community sector as well, to make sure that this great state becomes even greater in the future. Thanks very much and I'll hand to the Premier.\n\nROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thank you, Prime Minister. Delighted to have you in Western Australia once again. And it's a particularly important opportunity today. I want to acknowledge Tania Lawrence and Trish Cook as great Members and candidates for their areas. And of course, thank Brecken Health for the opportunity to have a look at one of the Urgent Care Clinics. As a former Minister for Health, I know just how important it is to have a strong primary health care system. And I'm delighted to see the way that the Albanese Government is tackling the issues of health care in Australia. The Urgent Care Clinics are so important to support our hospital system, which of course, as you know, is funded and run by the state governments. And my WA Labor Government is working hand in hand for the Albanese Labor Government to continue to make sure we put in place the resources, the policies, the laws and the supports that we need to continue to make Western Australia the engine room of the nation's economy. I want to reflect just for a moment on the importance of the announcement that the Prime Minister made earlier today. The opportunity to really activate the Kimberley and Northwest economies by creating first port of entries at Ashburton, Dampier and Wyndham Ports is so important to continue to grow the economy of our Northwest. This is, as the Prime Minister said, a game changer. It will significantly boost the economic activity, particularly in the East Kimberley. It means jobs, it means opportunities, and it means, particularly, in the East Kimberley, means opportunities for Aboriginal people who are working in some of some great organisations up there to really unlock the huge economic potential of the East Kimberley. In culinary, you've seen a significant boost in the cotton industry by the development of a cotton gin in Kununurra. That means that we'll be able to export directly from Kununurra and really just continue to boost the number of jobs and economic activity that takes place there. But it doesn't matter wherever you go in Western Australia, we know housing is always a challenge. It's a challenge in the metropolitan area, it's a challenge in regional WA. So, again, the comments this morning and the announcement by the Prime Minister is so important in ensuring that we unlock housing, particularly in places like Karratha, which are at a huge pace at the moment. We want to take the pressure off housing. We want to boost the amount of community education, health and other social services in these cities because we want to see them as places that can grow and be terrific areas of population growth and economic activity in our Northwest. So, when you see the $200 million announcement this morning, you see a whole range of activities to unlock the great potential of regional WA. And I want to take the opportunity just to thank the Federal Government for their work in this area.\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Happy to take some questions. Both of us, I think, have done long press conferences this morning, but happy to take a few questions.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister Angus Taylor says that Australians are $8,000 worse off than when they were in power, that they've never had it so bad.\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, Angus Taylor should reflect on the fact of how people would be had they not had energy price relief that they opposed. He needs to tell every taxpayer that he opposed every taxpayer getting a tax cut. He wanted it to just come to people like me and Roger, but wanted people working at a health clinic like this, an Urgent Care Clinic, to miss out. That's what Angus Taylor wanted. For those kids who come here and are brought here by their parents needing health care, if they're in childcare, he needs to tell them that those 1.2 million families, he thinks they shouldn't have benefited from Cheaper Child Care. For all those who've gone through Free TAFE here in WA, getting an apprenticeship and training for a job, he needs to tell them - as Sussan Ley did very bluntly - that they don't value anything which is free, which is why they have never, in their heart, ever supported Medicare. That's their view. Sussan Ley said it very clearly in the Parliament. So, whether it is tax cuts for every Australian, Free TAFE, Cheaper Child Care, Cheaper Medicines, all of those were opposed by Angus Taylor. People would have been worse off, and they'll be worse off again if they get their plan for sometime in the 2040s up, which will not only cost $1,200 more by going for the most expensive form of new energy, which is nuclear. But also, according to their own figures that they put out, will result in 40 per cent less energy use than is predicted by the Australian Energy Market Operator by 2040, by 2050. That means 40 per cent less economic activity, less making of things, less manufacturing, less economic activity, less jobs being created. A smaller vision for Australia. Angus Taylor is a part of an operation that just know what they're against, don't know what they're for, and they need more time to get their act together, because they certainly don't at this point in time.\n\nJOURNALIST: Do you acknowledge, though, that Australians are suffering the worst living standards that they've ever suffered?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, that's a very big claim. What I certainly acknowledge is that global inflation is having an impact here, as it has right around the world, has created pressures. The question is, what do you do about it? The question is, what do you do about it? My answer is that you provide cost of living relief and you do it in a way that puts that downward pressure on inflation. So, that when Angus Taylor was part of the show, the inflation rate was 2.1 per cent in one quarter in the March 2022 quarter. In one quarter, the last quarter they were fully in office. They presided over a deficit that was $78 billion that we turned into a $22 billion surplus and followed up with a $15 billion surplus. The question is, what do you do about it? Angus Taylor's answer is people should be worse off. People should be punished. People should not get cost of living relief. Which is why he's opposed every one of Labor's measures. And I make this point as well. We are now into 2025, an election year. They are yet to come up with - and Angus Taylor is the Shadow Treasurer - a single cost of living measure proposal. Not one. Not one. They speak about $315 billion of waste and cuts that they want to make. And we know the last time government changed to a Coalition Government in 2013, the first thing that Peter Dutton as Health Minister tried to do was to introduce a tax every time people went to see a doctor. You compare that with what we've done here. Free, more than a million Australians getting assistance when they need it, where they need it, quickly, efficiently, productively, taking pressure off public hospitals and emergency departments, delivering for families.\n\nJOURNALIST: Does your Government still think it's too dangerous to repatriate citizens from Syrian camps, as suggested by Trump's incoming counter-terrorism chief? And could this stance alienate the new US Administration?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: We'll make our own decisions based upon our own national security assessments.\n\nJOURNALIST: 27 visits to WA. It must be one of your favourites at the moment?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: I love the place and always have and always have. I was in Kununurra today. It's my first visit as Prime Minister. It was my fourth visit to Kununurra. I was there in 2009 when we developed the East Kimberley Economic Development Strategy, which led to - there at Wyndham, where the Port is going to be bigger and better than ever - we developed the boat ramp and the facilities there which were opened in 2012. I have - when we developed the next stage of Ord was under the Rudd Government at that time and as Regional Development Minister I have travelled throughout WA. It's not just Perth. As Prime Minister I've been to Kununurra, Port Hedland, Karratha, Kalgoorlie, Geraldton, Albany, Bunbury, right around this great state. There's something about this state's dynamism that is very attractive and we need to harness that in the national interest. That's what we do. It helps that Roger's followed Mark McGowan, another very good friend of mine. But I find WA people really welcoming whenever I'm here and there's a lot to be done. This is a growing, exciting state and under Roger's leadership I'm sure that will continue.\n\nJOURNALIST: What did you make of Roger's comments about his Government being an independent one, that he has differences of approach to your Government and that he'll be devoting his entire bandwidth to his own re-election as opposed to yours? Any concerns?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: He's here backing us up, with two candidates! As I'll be backing up Roger between now and March 8th. We have known each other a long period of time. All governments are independent. We make our own decisions but we work cooperatively. The fact that WA, for example, was the first big state to sign up to our Schools Agreement is just one example where that's there around the National Cabinet table. We cooperate. That doesn't mean that there's a unison. We have a three tiered system of government in Australia and that's something that we deal with. But I certainly wish Roger very well. I think that his Government is very deserving of re-election in March.\n\nJOURNALIST: The Premier has said in his submission to the Senate Committee considering the critical minerals legislation that the final investment decision deadline for hydrogen projects should be pushed back. And also that the community benefits principle, that there has not yet been consultation. Which is at odds with what you said yesterday, isn't it?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Yeah, well, we have consulted with industry but we'll go through. That's why you have Senate Committee. So, that's not inconsistent. We think that Production Tax Credits are a good idea. You know why? Because they incentivise investment and they reward success. Now we're backing the WA resources sector. The Coalition are opposing it.\n\nJOURNALIST: Have you failed to consult with the Premier on the community benefits principle?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Not at all. We have the legislation out there. If you think that we sit down with the pieces of legislation and go through line by line. That's not the process that we do, as you're fully aware, but this is good legislation. We'll go through. It is before the Parliament and it will make an enormously positive difference. Certainly, one of the things that we did was consult through the Minister, Madeleine King. She knows a bit about WA, Madeleine King, and she certainly has had extensive consultation with industry.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's a wheat belt sheep processing facility that says it's closing. The industry's blaming the export ban, the live export ban. Do you have a plan to assist with these workers with that side of the industry?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, it's a processing facility, not a live export facility, so - and that's a commercial decision. I make this point as well, that sheep meat exports in the last financial year were $4.8 billion. It's up from $4.5 billion. So, it's risen since the announcement and certainty was given. We've given industry certainty. And we have also provided an extensive package which will be worked through, as well, in terms of its implementation. The WA Government will assist with that process, in excess of $100 million. The truth is that the sheep meat exports are rising at the same time, as over a period of time, live exports have been in decline. We understand that this is an issue that has attracted some controversy, but we've been very clear. We've been to multiple elections, and we've provided certainty by providing that timeframe going forward.\n\nJOURNALIST: On the California wildfires, is the Government providing any financial aid at all?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: We haven't been requested at this point in time, but we've reached out to our friends in the United States. One of the things that has often happened is that during our seasons, because of the northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere, you have had cooperation, including personnel, have assisted. The American personnel helping here in Australia during our summers and vice versa. This is very unusual, or perhaps it's becoming more usual, that the seasons of these events are becoming longer. This is coming into their period where you wouldn't be expecting the sort of wildfires that we've seen in California.\n\nMy heart goes out on behalf of the Australian people to our friends in the United States. Those who've lost their lives, those who've lost their homes and properties and businesses. This is an extreme event. And people who see the footage will be shocked by it.\n\nI'll make one further point, which is that for many Australians who've experienced the horror of extreme bushfires, this will be a triggering event. If it is, please put your hand up. It is strong to ask for assistance. Ask for assistance. Get some counselling and support if you need it because this will be a difficult period.\n\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, and perhaps the Premier as well, just on this LA fire issue, Sarah Hanson-Young has linked it to climate change. Says this is why you, Prime Minister, and I think the state of WA as well, because you're such a big fossil fuel exporter, should stop exporting fossil fuels. Is that an appropriate link to make? Will you be addressing it in that framework?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: What you can't say is that any individual event is because of climate change, because I don't think that assists the debate either. What you can do is say, over a period of time, over a long period of time, the trends are very clear. Which is the science told us that there would be more extreme weather events, and they would be more intense. And that is what we are seeing played out in just about every continent on Earth. My Government is committed to taking action on climate change, to reducing our emissions. We've got a plan to do it. The Greens Party have rhetoric. They don't have a plan. And when people walk into a room like this and flick a switch, they expect the light to go on. So, what we need is a sensible transition. That is what is occurring. The last coal-fired power station here in WA, Roger will speak for himself, but it will be closing this decade. What we need is to make sure that we have renewables. But renewables also need to be firmed to provide certainty. And that's why gas will continue to play an important role. And that's a big distinction that we have with the Greens political party, and why you need storage as well. Now, those technologies are getting better. But that is what you need in order to provide, particularly for the manufacturing sector, the certainty to be able to invest in the transition that will occur.\n\nJOURNALIST: Can I just ask one last question, Prime Minister, if the RBA cut rates in February, will you lock in an early April election?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Good try. We had a long interview, one on one on the way down from Kununurra, and I didn't get that one. Just keep your eye on the on the car with the flag on it when it goes to Yarralumla. That's when I'll be calling the election. I've said this before, for a long period of time, three years is too short, in my view, for elections. I have no plan to change that, because I can't change that by myself. Peter Dutton said that he supported it and then it took him about two seconds to be negative in his usual negative way of saying, somehow, this was something that, in spite of the fact he called for it, was wrong, four-year fixed terms. That's what state governments have. You have certainty here. You know the election is on March 8. And that provides certainty four years ago. And that, to me, seems to make sense. Labor Policy has been since the 1970s to have four-year terms. That is something that a referendum I worked on in the 1980s that the Coalition said they supported it before they decided, funnily enough, to be negative and against it as well. We're the builders in Australia, the Labor Party. That's why our slogan at the election campaign is Building Australia's Future. They're the wreckers, which is why the first word of their slogan is 'back'. They just want to go backwards and take Australia backwards. We're going to take Australia forwards. But I won't be, I can confirm that, I'm not announcing the election date here today.\n\nJOURNALIST: On the port package, just quickly, the Premier had said he wanted to also see Federal support for the port plans at Kwinana and Geraldton and Oakajee. Is that something that you're open to exploring?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: We're open to working on a range of things. But I know that as well, that this comes on the top of what we've done at Broome already. The previous mob, what did they do? They were there for a decade. Crickets, essentially was the answer. We're getting on with things by doing it in an orderly way. And I think in terms of priority, these three ports have gone through a process of work. This isn't just a political decision. You've got to make sure that it can be done. You've got to do the work. We've done the work. And today, we're able to do the announcement.\n\nJOURNALIST: Can WA expect three more visits from you between now and May?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: Only three? Why only three?\n\nJOURNALIST: To reach your commitment?\n\nPRIME MINISTER: I'll reach the commitment. I'll do it in a canter. And I'll give you the big tip, which is that I worked out that was an easy commitment to give, because if you go back over the last 20 years, I, on average, have been here 10 times a year for 20 years. That's why I know where Gateway WA is. That's why I know that the Swan Valley Bypass, they changed the name of it, but it didn't change the funding and who actually started the project. That's why I know not every bit of this vast state, but I know a fair bit of it. And that's why I'm familiar with it. And that's important. If you want to represent the country, then you've got to actually be engaged with the country and be available. And I see that as something as positive. If you go back, importantly, I've been here more times than the three previous Prime Ministers have, by a fair margin. And it's something that shouldn't be, 'The Prime Minister's coming to WA, that's an annual event'. It should be something that is a regular just part of what the Australian Prime Minister should do, as I do, it must be said as well in other states and territories. And that's why this week, I was very pleased to, I think it was my 12th visit to the Northern Territory, and I spent Christmas Day there, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Cyclone Tracy.\n\nPREMIER COOK: Just going to the question you raised in relation to that. Western Australia is the only state in the country that will retire all its coal-fired power stations by 2030. So, when Sarah Hanson-Young flicks the switch on tonight, it's because someone, somewhere is burning coal. We are the only state that is committed to retiring all our coal-fired power stations by 2030. Now, the fact of the matter is that gas will play an important role in this as a smoothing fuel, but it will also play an important role as our close Southeast Asian trading partners retire their coal-fired power stations as well. So, as a transition fuel out of coal, it will play an important role in those countries which don't have the benefits of an abundance of wind and solar and other generating capacity. So, we understand the important role that fossil fuels play as part of emissions. In fact, coal is double the emissions of a gas-fired power station. So, let's get out of coal. And we're the only ones that are doing it.\n\nJOURNALIST: Just a question on the children's hospital. Are you planning or hoping places like this will take the pressure off a little bit?\n\nPREMIER COOK: A strong primary healthcare system is fundamental to a healthy hospital system. We want people to get regular and ongoing care from their GP, or in places like this, when they can get spontaneous, unplanned care, when that someone's had an accident, a disease, an onset of an illness, or a breaking bone. So, these are important places to take the pressure off our EDs. I was the Shadow Health Minister for eight and a half years. I was the Health Minister for five years. And I've never come across a government in my time that has tackled the problems associated with a healthy primary care system than this Government. And so, it's incredibly welcome. The Urgent Care Clinics are doing such an important job, not just on behalf of people accessing general practice, but on behalf of people who don't want to sit in a crowded ED.\n\nJOURNALIST: Premier, after the Bruce Highway announcement earlier this week, you suggested an 80-20 funding split should become the default arrangement. The Prime Minister has ruled that out. Is that disappointing?\n\nPREMIER COOK: No, just never stand between a Premier and a pot of Federal funds. Obviously, we'll always welcome more funding and that's one of my KPIs. And can I just say, look, I'll always do what's right for WA. And WA Labor governments have always worked strongly with Federal governments, whether it's in the great work that Prime Minister Albanese did when he was the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, whether it is getting our fair share of the GST, or the funding for our large METRONET projects. We work hard with our relationships with the Federal Government. In contrast, can I just say that the Liberals in WA have never done that. They've never been successful in growing strong relationships with the Federal Government. And that's why we see a march of funds away from WA when the Liberals are in power, and we see funds come to Western Australia when Labor is in power.\n\nJOURNALIST: Speaking of the pot of Federal funds, given $107 million doesn't really seem like enough, will you be asking the Federal Government to kick money into the METRONET on the Swan River?\n\nPREMIER COOK: Well, we're having conversations with them about METRONET on the Swan. We know that the Albanese Labor Government are strong supporters of public transport. They understand the importance in terms of vibrant cities, around people being able to move around those cities with an option of public transport means. And so, we continue to talk to them about all these arrangements.\n\nJOURNALIST: $107 million is not enough, is it?\n\nPREMIER COOK: $170 million is enough to construct the first two terminals, the five electric ferries and operating costs to about 2029. And we'll continue to look at all those costs and all the opportunities to attract extra resources to that project. But it's a game changer. It's great. We've talked about activating the Swan River in terms of public transport with ways of getting around the city for years, decades. And now, we're actually getting on with that job.\n\nJOURNALIST: You don't yet know the cost of a potential tender to build those ferries. So, how can you cost it at $107 million?\n\nPREMIER COOK: We are confident of the costings because they're based upon a request for quotes as part of an EOI process. The Minister made this clear when we announced the ferry service last weekend. So, we know that these are the sort of costs that suppliers or manufacturers are anticipating in relation to constructing these ferries. Can I just say too, these ferries will be built in WA, and they'll be electric ferries. And this is again, part of our effort to continue to boost manufacturing in Western Australia.\n\nJOURNALIST: Premier, will you be having any direct contact, a visit, with the survivors of the seaplane incident, in particular, the international tourists?\n\nPREMIER COOK: Well, look, if the opportunity presents itself and they want to have a conversation with the Government about their experience, obviously we'd be open to that. They've been through a harrowing ordeal. They are tourists to Western Australia. They are a part of our family. And our hearts go out to them, particularly those who have lost loved ones. And we are working tirelessly through our WA Police to help the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to undertake its work so that we can understand what's happened in this instance.

However, food inflation remains high, with many Nigerians seeing little to no improvement in affordability.\n\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) paints a grim picture of Nigeria's food inflation trajectory:\n\nJune 2024: Food inflation surged to 40.87 per cent in June 2024, up from 40.66 per cent in May. Meanwhile, a slight decrease was recorded in July to 39.53 per cent, followed by further reductions in August to 37.52 per cent and September 37.77 per cent.\n\nInflation also rose to 39.16 per cent in October, while food inflation stood at 39.93 per cent while overall inflation hit 34.6 per cent in November.\n\nThe rising cost of staples such as garri, yam, rice, and palm oil has left millions struggling to afford basic meals. This trend is exacerbating poverty, eroding purchasing power, and amplifying socio economic hardships.\n\nREAD ALSO: Arewa Youth alleges politicians exploiting Niger crisis to undermine Tinubu's administration\n\nIn his New Year message, President Bola Tinubu acknowledged the country's inflation crisis and vowed to bring relief through intensified efforts in food production and local manufacturing.\n\nHe pledged to reduce inflation to 15% by the end of 2025.\n\n\"We are resolute in our ambition to reduce inflation from its current high of 34.6% to 15%. With diligent work and God's help, we will achieve this goal and provide relief to all our people,\" Tinubu said.\n\nDespite these assurances, experts and citizens have raised concerns about the lack of visible progress.\n\nEconomic and agricultural experts have identified multiple factors undermining the government's policies: Gbolade Idakolo, CEO of SD & D Capital Management, criticized the 150-day zero-tariff policy as a failed initiative due to bureaucratic inefficiencies.\n\n\"In a saner climate, those responsible for implementing such policies would have been held accountable. The policy timeframe should have been at least two years to allow for significant impact,\" Idakolo stated.\n\nDr. Samson Simon, an economist at ARKK Economics and Data Limited, lamented the lack of prioritization for agriculture.\n\nREAD ALSO: NACCIMA urges Tinubu to prioritize tax reforms for economic growth\n\n\"Nigeria is at the bottom of the global food security index in terms of food availability and affordability. Agriculture remains underfunded and underdeveloped, with less than ₦1 trillion allocated to the sector in the 2025 budget,\" Simon said.\n\nHe also linked recent stampede deaths in Ibadan, Anambra, and Abuja to rising food insecurity.\n\nSimon highlighted insecurity as a significant barrier to agricultural productivity, with many farmers unable to access their lands due to fears of violence, kidnapping, or death.\n\n\"We must mechanize agriculture, improve research, and ensure security to enable farmers to work without fear,\" he emphasized.\n\nExperts have suggested a comprehensive approach to address Nigeria's food inflation crisis, including increase in funding to agriculture, enhanced security and engaging state governments, private sectors, and international partners to drive food production and distribution.\n\nAs food inflation continues to strain households, Nigerians are calling for greater accountability from the government.\n\nThe failure of past interventions has deepened mistrust, with many questioning the administration's commitment to tackling food insecurity.\n\n\"The poor masses don't realize their power and how to demand better from leaders. Ethnic and religious biases often cloud their judgment, allowing non-performing leaders to remain in power,\" Simon remarked.","source":{"uri":"nationaldailyng.com","dataType":"news","title":"National Daily NG"},"authors":[{"uri":"olusegun_odunewu@nationaldailyng.com","name":"Olusegun Odunewu","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://nationaldailyng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tinubu-7.jpg","eventUri":"eng-10226907","sentiment":-0.07450980392156858,"wgt":474107443,"relevance":18},{"uri":"b-2025-01-597485879","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"08:29:35","dateTime":"2025-01-09T08:29:35Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T08:18:47Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://www.defenseworld.net/2025/01/09/norfolk-southern-co-nysensc-receives-consensus-rating-of-moderate-buy-from-analysts.html","title":"Norfolk Southern Co.

The first tax is applied to the total bill amount, while the second is levied on fuel cost adjustments.\n\nEarlier, the federal government has made a key decision to meet another significant condition set by the IMF, agreeing to impose a levy on captive power plants before the release of the next tranche of funding.\n\nAccording to sources, the government has made preparations to implement this levy on captive power plants, which will be applied gradually to prevent a significant reduction in gas supply to these plants.\n\nSources indicated that the IMF has shown flexibility on the issue of gas cuts to captive power plants, and the levy will be introduced before the next IMF tranche is disbursed.\n\nMoreover, the federal government has reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to end the minimum support price (MSP) system for wheat.\n\nAfter the agreement, the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat would not be announced for 2025-26, sources said.\n\nMinistry of National Food Security and Research directed the provinces to submit their wheat food security suggestions based on their population. Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday stressed the need to honour IMF commitments, insisting that the government could not bid farewell to the programme just yet.\n\nWhile talking to the business community at the Pakistan Stock Exchange, the premier said, \"We need to honour IMF commitments - we can't just say tata bye bye (dismiss the programme on a whim) once we take off.\n\n\"We will say goodbye to it forever once the time is right,\" he said. Regarding the business community's role, the premier insisted that the government and the business leaders needed to \"build their relationship to achieve those targets\", giving the example of their tax targets.\n\n\"If you look at what IMF stated [their target as] 10.6 tax-to-GDP ratio, we have achieved 10.8,\" he said. \"It's something to celebrate but this is not enough - this is just the beginning.\"\n\nThe premier insisted that there was a need for investment now, recounting that the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) interest rate went from a record-high of 22 per cent to 13pc.\n\n\"Investors here say there is still a gap of 8 points - I would want it to go to 6pc,\" he stressed, \"But it has to be done with an alert mind, with prudence, so we don't get trapped in the future.\n\n\"We have to move bravely but with caution,\" he added. \"Regarding that, how do we actualise export-led growth? Everyone says growth should be export-led, that FDI [foreign direct investment] should be export-led so that profits come and dollars are present so we can retain them - all very well said but I need tangible proposals on how to implement export-led growth.\"\n\nThe prime minister went on to compare Pakistan with Saudi Arabia \"in a different context to the world\", highlighting that the country had mines and minerals while Saudi Arabia had \"black gold\". PM Shehbaz insisted the country had to head towards growth, adding that he knew that critics often spoke about \"the engine heating up\" and \"Pakistan heading towards a boom-bust cycle once again\" when it came to pursuing growth.\n\n\"A lot of experts have spoken and writers have written about it, but I invite you to come tell us what other way is there?\" he rhetorically asked.\n\nOn the privatisation issue, the premier said that the process had been entirely transparent, citing the example of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) which the government failed to privatise in the first attempt. \"The entire process was 100pc transparent just like Islamabad Airport, the privatisation process for which is about to be concluded in the next few days,\" he said.","source":{"uri":"dailytimes.com.pk","dataType":"news","title":"Daily Times"},"authors":[{"uri":"sajid_salamat@dailytimes.com.pk","name":"Sajid Salamat","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2022/05/26/imf-pakistan.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.05882352941176472,"wgt":474107005,"relevance":100},{"uri":"8492301447","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"08:20:49","dateTime":"2025-01-09T08:20:49Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T08:11:37Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.7921568751335144,"url":"https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2025/01/mil-250108-india-mea01.htm","title":"Foreign Secretary's meeting with the Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan","body":"Today, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had a meeting with the Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, in Dubai.

More is on the way, with the polar air expected to continue to grip some places until at least Friday.\n\nFarmers always watch the weather, but depending on where they're located and what they produce, winter always presents mental challenges for growers, said Carolyn Olson, an organic farmer in southwestern Minnesota who is also vice president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors.\n\nProducers know the timing and amount of winter moisture affect farming conditions for the rest of the year. It's also a time for planning ahead -- something becoming increasingly difficult as climate change ramps up variability in snowfall, rainfall and other weather conditions that can make or break an operation.\n\nPeople are also reading...

East Councilman Pollard apologizes for statements, violating council code of conduct\n\n\"They're doing that stressful part of making those decisions on how they're going to farm this year, what they're going to grow,\" Olson said. \"It's just a lot of pressure on agriculture at this time of the year.\"\n\nA generational storm\n\nBiting wind and big drifts from almost a whole year's average snowfall in a single storm are hitting farmers in some parts of Kansas \"in ways that we haven't seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a lifetime,\" said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State University who developed an animal comfort tool.\n\nIt includes an index of heat and cold that a farmer can use -- along with their knowledge of their animals' age, coat, overall health and so forth -- to watch for situations when they may need to get animals out of dangerous areas.\n\nThe risk is real: Calves, especially, can die when temperatures slip below zero. So much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from reaching herds with food and water, Redmond said.\n\nThat means preparing by moving animals and having a plan to care for them ahead of time is key -- which is harder due to the unpredictability of climate change. Not having the right experience or infrastructure to prepare is \"really, really stressful on producers,\" Redmond said.\n\nReprieve for some areas\n\nThe storm missed some states further north like Iowa and Minnesota that are generally more accustomed to snow. Stu Swanson, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said that eases tasks like moving grain and working with livestock.\n\nHe added that without snow cover, the ground is more likely to freeze and thaw in a way that could benefit soils. Two years of drought followed by torrential rains last spring created tire ruts and compaction from farm machinery in some places, he said. He hopes that without as much snow, the freeze-thaw cycle will loosen up the soil and farmers may get the added bonus of some pests dying off before the spring.\n\n\"We don't have any growing crop now, so really temperature doesn't matter. We look forward to a good freeze,\" Swanson said.\n\nExtremes and unpredictability\n\nThe lack of snow is a greater concern farther north in some parts of Minnesota, where producers do have winter crops like alfalfa or winter wheat.\n\nReliable snow cover is important in those areas because it insulates soil from cold. A few of inches of snow on top of a field can keep winter wheat's crown (which is still underground this time of year to withstand the winter) at 28 degrees Fahrenheit even if the air temperature is as low as minus 40, said Jochum Wiersma, an extension professor at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\"There's not a lot you can do, unfortunately,\" when ice breaks a plant's crown, said Martin Larsen, who grows alfalfa in addition to other crops like corn in southeastern Minnesota. He's concerned about the long-term trends, too -- he pointed out last year's likely record warmth -- and said he noticed the lack of snow cover in his region then, too.\n\n\"We were so dry going into last spring and we were in the field almost a month before we normally do. I would say that concern exists this year as well,\" Larsen said.\n\nGary Prescher, who has been farming a small grain operation for about 50 years in south-central Minnesota, said he's noticed more variability over the past six to 10 years. That's changing his long-term philosophy on the farm.\n\nHe said he wants to make sure his operation can handle more extreme weather events, and that excess heat, cold, dryness, wetness or wind have \"forced some changes out here for me and my neighbors.\"\n\n\"If you're just looking at averages, it's very deceiving,\" he said. \"It's either all or none.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.","source":{"uri":"heraldcourier.com","dataType":"news","title":"HeraldCourier.com"},"authors":[],"image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/heraldcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/23/f2341532-e66d-5b8d-8e1a-ebe5a9986db5/677f7fd858590.image.jpg?crop=519%2C272%2C0%2C93&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.01960784313725494,"wgt":474106739,"relevance":38},{"uri":"8492301467","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"08:17:36","dateTime":"2025-01-09T08:17:36Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T08:11:37Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2025/01/ukraine-250108-ukraine-president05.htm","title":"President of Ukraine Had a Phone Conversation with the Amir of Qatar","body":"President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a phone conversation with the Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.\n\nThe Head of State thanked Qatar for participating in the first Peace Summit, mediating the return of 53 children illegally abducted from Ukraine by Russia, and providing them with necessary medical and psychological care.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani agreed to continue active cooperation on the return of Ukrainian children forcibly displaced by Russia.\n\nThey also discussed cooperation to support Syria.

Wheat and cotton, two of Pakistan's five major crops, are projected to perform poorly in FY2025.\n\nThe Asian Development Outlook for December 2024 also revised growth for FY2024, upwards to 2.5%, in line with the updated official estimate.\n\nIn South Asia, the growth forecasts have been revised downward to 5.9% for 2024 and 6.3% for 2025. The lower forecast for 2024 is mainly due to India's lower-than-expected Quarter 2 growth, driven by dampened manufacturing sector performance and lagging government spending.\n\nWhile growth forecasts for Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been upgraded due to their recovery from the macroeconomic challenges of 2022- 2023, downward revisions for Bangladesh and Maldives have further weighed on the 2024 outlook.\n\nThe latter two economies' growth forecasts are also revised downward for 2025 due to the lingering effects of the political unrest of July-August 2024 in Bangladesh and fiscal consolidation measures in Maldives. Some weakening of growth is also expected for 2025 in Nepal relative to earlier forecasts.\n\nAccording to the report, the growth forecast for developing Asia is trimmed to 4.9% for 2024 and 4.8% for 2025. Most adjustments to 2024 growth projections for individual economies and sub-regions are based on recent data releases.\n\nThe downward revisions to East Asia and South Asia offset the stronger growth in the Caucasus and Central Asia and Southeast Asia, shaving 0.1 percentage points from growth in the region. For 2025, slower growth is expected in South Asia due to weaker domestic demand prospects.\n\nAccording to the report, developing Asia's growth remains solid, but the new US presidential administration promises consequential changes. Domestic demand remains strong in much of the region, and exports continue to support growth, although momentum has moderated.\n\nThe incoming Trump administration promises significant policy changes with implications for the region, as discussed in this report's Special Topic. Most of the impact will be felt beyond this ADO's forecast horizon, however.\n\nWhile growth projections for 2024-2025 remain largely unchanged from September, downside risks persist and include faster and larger US policy shifts than currently envisioned, a worsening of geopolitical tensions, and an even weaker PRC property market.","source":{"uri":"app.com.pk","dataType":"news","title":"Associated Press Of Pakistan"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.app.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ADB-Pakistan.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.3254901960784313,"wgt":474106577,"relevance":18},{"uri":"8492304050","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"08:15:45","dateTime":"2025-01-09T08:15:45Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T08:13:24Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://heraldcourier.com/the-great-drone-debate/article_09218250-1c69-52fd-abbd-f84b65860024.html","title":"THE GREAT DRONE DEBATE","body":"Russell Hedrick of hickory, N.C., shows footage of when he used his drone to drop supplies to people during hurricane Helene recovery.\n\nDIDI TANG\n\nAssociated Press\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nThe economic and technological rivalry between the United States and China has come to the drone market, where Chinese-made flying devices are a dominant player.\n\nU.S. lawmakers seek to ban new sales of drones from two dominant Chinese manufacturers, arguing they could be used to spy on Americans and that the low-cost models are hurting the U.S. drone industry.\n\nThe defense bill that Congress passed in late December would bar new Chinese drones from DJI Technology and Autel Robotics should a review find them to pose an \"unacceptable\" risk to U.S. national security.\n\nBut American users, from police officers to farmers, mappers and filmmakers, have come to rely on Chinese-made drones, especially those by DJI.\n\nHere are some things to know about the drone debate.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Then, in 2017 I had my first encounter with Korean music - it was a song called 'Likey' by a group called 'TWICE'. I listened to it over and over again.\n\nI'm not a big fan of it now, but I was at the time. It wasn't long after that before BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, and Blackpink made it to British radio. At that point I knew that it was beginning to become globally recognised.\n\nIn October of 2019, me and one of my best friends, Tristan, travelled to Japan and South Korea. That same year we travelled to Australia. After coming back I had the post-holiday blues and the urge to learn a second language. I chose Korean. I twice watched a one-hour video that taught me the Korean alphabet and downloaded an app called 'Hellotalk' which matches you with a native speaker of the language you want to learn, who also wants to learn your native language. Six years later, I still have some friends that I met on that app and, eventually, in real life. Having friends from the country of the language that you are learning and seeing how good they are at your native language, motivates you.\n\nJigjisa, Gimcheon, South Korea Dan in Busan\n\nQ: What course did you study at York St John University?\n\nA: At York St John University, I studied Korean, Intercultural and Contemporary Communication. It was a four-year course, spending year three abroad at a partnered Korean university. The third year did not count academically, rather as a year of experience. Everyone's year was different but I spent mine taking Korean intensive classes. For four hours each day we learned grammar, and had writing, reading, listening and speaking practice. I was at Gachon University just outside the South Korean capital Seoul and could not have asked for a better experience. I had fantastic teachers and professors at both Gachon University and at York St John University, who didn't just educate me, but instead made me a better person and inspired me to become passionate about language in many different aspects.\n\nQ: When you first went there did you settle down straight away or does it take a while to adjust?\n\nA: I enjoyed my year in South Korea from beginning to end. When I moved out of university accommodation and into my own place in central Seoul just before my second term, I began to feel at home. The intensive language classes taught me valuable and useful skills which I used in real-life interactions. It was this comfort with the language and my schedule that allowed me to imagine a potential future in South Korea.\n\nQ: Where did you live and what sort of things did you do?\n\nA: I lived in the dormitory on campus, at the top of a hill. Korea is quite a mountainous country - I don't know why but it is common for universities to be built on top of the steepest of hills.\n\nThere wasn't much there apart from the campus and a highway. After finishing my class, I took the subway into Seoul, so to make the most of my free time, so I later decided to move to an area near Konkuk University in eastern Seoul.\n\nIt wasn't just my first time living in Korea, but it was also my first time living in a capital city. I lived close to the famous Han River, where I would often go jogging. I enjoyed being able to explore different areas every day. The vastness of Seoul blew me away. Being a boy from York who had lived in the same house and walked the same roads all his life, discovering the hidden gems of Seoul was my favourite hobby.\n\nDuring my time there I managed to visit places such as the port of Busan and Jeju Island. However, I also managed to go to Yeosu and Geoje on the south coast and famous for their beautiful sea views. The city of Jeonju was my final trip and was the perfect getaway from the bustling life of Seoul. It's Jeonju is very peaceful and famous for Hanok buildings - the traditional architecture of Korea.\n\nA: The majority of Korean people are welcoming. Since returning here as a teacher, to the small city of Gimcheon, I am extremely lucky to have co-workers who looked after me from the first day, as if I had been there for years.\n\nAged 26, I am the youngest teacher in my school. This is a fairly large middle school, with around 680 students aged from 13 to 15 and around 50 teachers. Although slightly overwhelming in the beginning, the more I learned the students' names and adjusted to my schedule, I stopped feeling like the 'new guy'. The atmosphere in my office is always enjoyable, and it was nice to feel accepted straight away by my co-workers. I appreciate the fun times and the laughter, as well as the guidance that they offer me. My experience here would be much less positive if it wasn't for them.\n\nIn a general sense, being foreign can make even the more simple interactions fun. People being curious about where I am from, or wondering how I can speak Korean, or what type of work I do. makes me feel happy. You'll also occasionally experience the most random English conversations when you least expect it. While second-hand shopping at a traditional market in Seoul, the owner of the stall started chatting with me. Within 30 seconds, we were somehow talking about South Korean politics. Interactions like that make me feel welcome in some strange way.\n\nGimcheon Jeonju Deokjin Park, Jonju\n\nQ: What is the food like? Any special national dishes?\n\nA: I'm always slightly jealous of Korea in that it has many national dishes in comparison to the UK. My students often ask me which British foods are famous and I find it difficult to name more than English breakfast, fish and chips, Sunday dinner and pies.\n\nKoreans make their food really well. From bibimbap, to barbecue, to cold wheat noodles, I struggle to find a restaurant that doesn't hit the spot. My biggest problem - and other foreigners in Korea would agree with me - is that everything is sweet. Even things that shouldn't be sweet, are sweet, such as crisps, bread, garlic mayonnaise and cheese. With garlic mayonnaise I feel like I'm dipping my pizza crust into some sort of syrup. And I can't find sausages that aren't hot dog style, which is strange as pork belly is one of the most famous dishes in Korea. I miss a good old English sarnie.\n\nQ: Are there any customs that are part of Korean life?\n\nA: Bowing has become so natural for me now, and I enjoy it. As a British man who was raised to have good manners, I think bowing to others when greeting or being appreciative is a great way of showing respect. Receiving and giving things to others using two hands also feels very polite and is second nature to me now. Something that is difficult however, is using titles in many more situations than we would in the UK. It's difficult in the sense that I can't just call someone by their name, I have to know the word for their specific title. For example, I needed to learn the word for Administration Office Manager before I went to speak to him today. I also call the principal and vice principal by their title and not their name. I understand the respect behind it but it all feels a little impersonal sometimes. It also makes it more difficult to learn names since I very rarely need to know them. It is also becomes a bit overwhelming when meeting a new person since saying 'you' is uncommon and even rude in some instances.\n\nTtukseom River Park, Seoul\n\nQ: What is it like teaching English to Korean students, do they pick it up quite quickly?\n\nA: Teaching English to Korean students lets you experience every emotion. On some days, we laugh hysterically, on some, concentration levels are at maximum capacity. On some, I grow frustrated at how difficult Korean children have it because of how relentless the education system can be. On others, I can see their ambition and their pure hearts.\n\nFrom my personal experience, Korea sometimes has a problem with focusing too much on money and status. Although generating ambition in some, it can weigh heavy on young minds who just want to be happy. We should be defined by our human qualities, and not by our occupation or our income.\n\nQ: What sorts of questions do they ask you about the UK?\n\nA: Most Korean children know relatively little about the UK. They are exposed to the US far more. However, one thing that I get asked about is football. Unfortunately, I had to spend some time teaching my students what 'glory supporter' meant so that they could understand what I was calling them. Even one of the kids who is a Man United 'fan' said he wants to go to the UK to watch a Liverpool game because they are better. I have had two kids say that they are now Newcastle fans because of me, but I feel they are just saying this to make me feel better.\n\nI often have to explain the difference between accents within the UK. I hear people say the 'British' accent, when referring to that of Harry Potter, the Queen or Benedict Cumberbatch. When I tell them that my Yorkshire accent is much cooler than what they've seen in the movies, the regard me with blank emotion. Despite this, I have successfully managed to get 680 students saying \"Ey up\" every time they see me. Mission successful.\n\nQ: Can you now understand most things in the spoken Korean language and chat quite normally?\n\nA: I would describe myself as a middle-to-high intermediate speaker.\n\nAlthough I enjoy conversing in Korean, I am still at a low enough level where I have to concentrate on the conversation in order to get the gist of what is being said. The way in which I speak too can sometimes sound quite unnatural to a native speaker, but as long as what I am saying is understood by the listener, I am happy with that.\n\nQ: What is the supermarket shopping experience like?\n\nA: Groceries are extremely expensive compared to UK supermarkets, especially fruit. Four apples for example, I have seen for about 10000won here, which is about £6. Strawberries and tomatoes are also particularly costly. Cooking at home is what I am used to, but the prices make you question whether it's worth it. Eating out is much cheaper than the UK, so people eat out on a fairly regular basis. If you live near one, traditional markets, usually run by the older generation, are a good way of buying cheaper produce.\n\nQ: How do young people relax and socialise?\n\nLike in the UK, they play sports, they're into music, they sleep... One difference I can think of though, is PC rooms. Many Korean families live in apartments and the lack of space led to PC rooms becoming popular among young people. They pay a small fee for time spent there, and get to use a modern, often gaming PC to play whatever games they own, with the highest internet speed. Some PC rooms even have self-serve food or allow you to order food.\n\nThe café culture is incredible - there are cafes everywhere and almost all of them sell desserts and pastries. Korea is also famous for karaoke rooms where friends pay a small fee to have private access to sing their hearts out.\n\nA: There is a notion that Korean transport is flawless, and while that is largely true in Seoul, Busan and other metropolitan cities, it isn't the case where I live. In the larger cities, you can track the bus down to the minute, the subways are never late, and trains are rarely delayed for more than two minutes. High-speed trains (KTX) are good quality and affordable.\n\nHere, it's not so good - the app will say that there is no estimated time of arrival available until the bus is within 30 seconds of me.\n\nQ: What is the cost of property like?\n\nA: One similarity with the UK is the extortionate price of housing, especially in Seoul. The place that I lived in in Seoul was half the size of my current place, and double the price.\n\n*Are there any aspects of life that you prefer in South Korea, compared with the UK?\n\nI love the affordable restaurant prices - it allows me to regularly try foods that I am unable to make myself. I also love how late places are open. This was something I struggled to adapt to when I was back in the UK. Restaurants, cafes, places to play pool, shops, karaoke rooms, the list goes on. It gives people who work nine to five something to do afterwards that isn't just drinking.\n\nI like the bells on tables in restaurants, so you are not just patiently waiting to get the staff's attention.\n\nConvenience stores everywhere and usually open 24 hours. As well as this, I can order something online and it will be at my door before 7am the next morning.\n\nIn a more general sense, I miss the nostalgic and emotional aspects of the UK. I miss the Yorkshire accent. I miss seeing dogs bigger than 40cm long. I miss people holding the door. I miss the small talk. I miss good cheese that doesn't cost a fortune. I miss bread that doesn't taste like sugar. I also really miss my mum's Sunday roasts, and, of course, my mum. But that's the fact of life - wherever you go there are pros and cons. You have to appreciate what is good in your life.","source":{"uri":"thetelegraphandargus.co.uk","dataType":"news","title":"Telegraph and Argus"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/resources/images/18945036/","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.09019607843137245,"wgt":474106293,"relevance":7},{"uri":"8492294415","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"08:07:02","dateTime":"2025-01-09T08:07:02Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T08:06:39Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.naijanews.com/2025/01/09/hunger-crisis-why-tinubus-food-import-policy-remains-unimplemented/","title":"Hunger Crisis: Why Tinubu's Food Import Policy Remains Unimplemented","body":"Sources within the Presidency revealed that the private sector is spearheading this pushback, arguing that unrestricted food imports could undermine domestic production, erode investments, and exacerbate unemployment.\n\nWhile the waiver aimed to combat food inflation, critics describe it as a double-edged sword with significant economic risks.\n\nA Presidency insider, speaking anonymously with The Punch, stated, \"A lot of media outfits have been publishing on the failure of the government to implement the waiver on food imports.\n\n\"The real reason why the government is slowing it down is the need to protect local companies. Many local companies and groups like MAN (Manufacturers Association of Nigeria), LCCI (Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry) and industries have put pressure on the FG not to import food as that is not a solution. The focus should be to increase local production.\"\n\nAnother source said members of the Organised Private Sector have insisted that \"importation will kill local companies and jobs.\"\n\nPrivate sector operators have echoed these concerns, with some describing the policy as a temporary relief measure that risks long-term damage.\n\nNational Vice President of the Nigerian Association of Small-Scale Industrialists, Segun Kuti-George, said, \"The food import waiver idea is a double-edged sword, and like any other issues you are trying to proffer solutions to, as you are trying to solve a problem, you are likely to be giving rise to another problem.\n\n\"What usually informs decision making is that when you weigh the pros and cons, ascertain whether the pros are higher than the cons before going ahead.\n\n\"All we need to do is to weigh it on a scale to ascertain which has more advantage.\"\n\nAnnounced by Agriculture Minister Abubakar Kyari on July 10, 2024, the policy suspended duties, tariffs, and taxes on importing maize, husked brown rice, wheat, and cowpeas for 150 days.\n\nKyari had said, \"To ameliorate food inflation in the country caused by affordability and exacerbated by availability, the government has taken a raft of measures to be implemented over the next 180 days.\n\n\"A 150-day duty-free import window for food commodities, suspension of duties, tariffs, and taxes for the importation of certain food commodities (through land and sea borders). These commodities include maize, husked brown rice, wheat, and cowpeas. Under this arrangement, imported food commodities will be subjected to a Recommended Retail Price.\"\n\nThe government also planned to import 250,000 metric tonnes of wheat and maize for distribution to small-scale processors and millers.\n\nHowever, the implementation has stalled, leaving Nigerians to grapple with rising hunger.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Nigeria Customs Service estimated that the government could lose ₦188.37 billion in revenue over six months due to the waiver.\n\nAdditionally, companies wishing to benefit from the policy were required to be at least five years old and registered in Nigeria, further complicating execution.\n\nCritics, including small business advocates and economists, argue that the waiver's non-implementation reflects policy inconsistencies and government inefficiency.\n\nPresident of the Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Femi Egbesola, lamented, \"We had blame games going on for different reasons among key implementers, particularly between the Nigeria Customs Service and Federal Ministry of Finance for the justification of non-implementation.\n\n\"It speaks to the anarchy among government MDAs, resulting in policy somersaults, and causing untold hardship on the economy and the citizens.\n\n\"Standard global practice is that if your country has a huge food deficit, the government must find a way to bridge the gap, most times on a short term through imports and plan medium and long term solutions by supporting, intervening and incentivising the agriculture sector. At times even with subsidies. The life and wellbeing of an average Nigerian should be of topmost priority and shouldn't be mortgaged on the table of business or profiteering.\"\n\nEconomist and sustainability expert, Marcel Okeke, also highlighted the risks of undermining local producers.\n\n\"There are implications given our system. You know the corruption in the system. Implementation is the challenge. You know the gatekeepers and the way they operate. Do you think everyone will fall in line?\n\n\"There is nothing that they want to import that is not being produced by someone here in Nigeria already. The issue is the insufficiency of the production which is why demand is outstripping supply.\n\n\"The waiver is like pricing the local producers out of existence. There was a time in this country when we had so many of them in the textile industry when the government opened up to allow different textiles to come in, that was the death of the sector,\" he said.\n\nOkeke further pointed out that poor quality control could lead to substandard imports flooding the market, emphasizing the need for self-reliance in food production.\n\n\"I'm doubtful if this initiative will be properly implemented and that this door will be opened and shut within the specified period. What will happen within that time is likely to go out of the government's control and will spell a calamity for local producers of those items.\n\n\"Also, since these local producers will now know it is cheaper and easier to import, why bother to kill themselves to produce in this inclement environment? Once the gate is opened, they will jump at it. If these people cannot stop the government from doing what it wants to do, they will join them.\n\n\"There will also be the challenge of quality. If care Is not taken, all kinds of quality will be dumped on the country. The best approach is to grow everything organically and that means encouraging people within our boundaries to be the ones to give us what we want. So importation will be to supplement what is being produced here,\" he added.\n\nFinance Minister Wale Edun acknowledged the mounting pressure and assured stakeholders that the government is revisiting the policy to ensure it does not harm domestic food production.\n\n\"We are addressing emerging issues that will not make the policy undermine domestic food production capacity,\" he said.","source":{"uri":"naijanews.com","dataType":"news","title":"Naija News"},"authors":[{"uri":"ikenna_ngere@naijanews.com","name":"Ikenna Ngere","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SGF-Swearing-Tinubu.jpeg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.207843137254902,"wgt":474106022,"relevance":89},{"uri":"8492286565","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"08:02:02","dateTime":"2025-01-09T08:02:02Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T08:00:59Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.5176470875740051,"url":"https://www.brandonsun.com/local/2025/01/09/lets-do-something-jan-9-2025","title":"Let's Do Something  --  Jan. 9, 2025","body":"To get your event featured in a future edition of Let's Do Something, please send an email to carthur@brandonsun.com with \"Let's Do Something\" in the subject line.\n\nTODAY\n\n* Daily -- The public skating oval at 2020 McGregor Ave. is open for the season.

It was the same for Homs,\" said Abu Jamil, 47, a greengrocer at the Souk al-Hal in central Damascus.\n\n\"They were all controlled by the Fourth Division,\" he added, referring to the army unit commanded by Bashar al-Assad's notoriously rapacious brother, Maher al-Assad.\n\nDuring the war, with state revenues in tatters, the Fourth Division asserted control over many areas of the economy in a bid to extract rent from any available opportunity.\n\nBut with the checkpoints gone, the prices for many goods has plummeted.\n\nPotatoes are less than half their former price, falling from SYP 9,000 per kilogram ($0.75) to SYP 4,000 ($0.33).\n\nBananas from Lebanon have fallen by a third, whilst olive oil from the northern province of Idlib is just a quarter of the price Damascenes were paying in November last year.\n\nAccording to the FX tracking website, black market dollar rates for the Syrian lira surged to 22,000 around the time of Assad's downfall, but have since stabilised at approximately 12,000 this week.\n\nOther popular consumables such as cigarettes, where wholesale was monopolised by the Fourth Division, have also fallen dramatically. A pack of 20 cigarettes that cost SYP 13,000 just a month ago, now sells for SYP 7,000.\n\nExperts have pointed to two other factors easing the prices of foodstuffs. The sustained decrease in the exchange rate of the Syrian lira has allowed imports to become less expensive.\n\nMeanwhile, the collapse of the Assad government's armed forces has increased the amount of available food for sale on domestic markets.\n\n\"The basic goods that used to be prioritised for the 170,000 soldiers are now diverted into the market and this in turn has increased the supply,\" said Mohamad Ahmad, an economist at Karam Shaar Advisory.\n\n\"The decrease in prices could be sustainable,\" added Ahmad, \"especially if other factors remain stable such as customs and taxes, and certainly the stability of the exchange rate.\"\n\nWhilst the falling cost of putting meat and vegetables on the table certainly helps make daily life more affordable for many Syrians, there is a risk that new government policies could make bread prices double in the near future.\n\nIn the last week, the interim minister for internal trade and consumer protection, Maher Khalil al-Hasan, announced a controversial plan to scrap the bread subsidy in Syria within the next two months.\n\nBread had been one of the few goods which the former government continued to subsidise throughout the conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, the news on food prices is also tempered by the wider economic malaise that poses serious challenges for Syrians in the immediate future.\n\nSyria's economy collapsed during the conflict, contracting by 84 percent according to World Bank data, pushing nearly 90 percent of Syrians into poverty.\n\nEconomic recovery is hampered by far-reaching sanctions imposed by the West on individuals and institutions associated with the former government and entities designated as a terrorist organisation, notably Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, which led the offensive against Assad.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Hasan warned that Syria faces a \"catastrophe\" if sanctions are not lifted, as they prevent the import of vital goods such as fuel, wheat, and other essentials.\n\nThe most comprehensive of these sanctions regimes is the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, passed by the US Congress in 2019. It severely restricts Syria's ability to import or export nearly all goods.\n\nThe Joe Biden administration has announced some sanctions waivers for activities crucial to providing humanitarian assistance and supporting economic recovery, such as energy provision.\n\nHowever, with many sanctions still in effect, the full impact of these waivers remains to be seen.","source":{"uri":"ifpnews.com","dataType":"news","title":"Iran Front Page"},"authors":[],"image":"https://ifpnews.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=331802&type=iran-front-page&hash=d29856de6d514cc46ae2571dcff4520b","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.1215686274509804,"wgt":474105538,"relevance":12},{"uri":"b-8492281819","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"07:57:57","dateTime":"2025-01-09T07:57:57Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T07:57:08Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://skepticalscience.com/new_research_2025_2.html","title":"Skeptical Science New Research for Week #2 2025","body":"Climate warming may accelerate decomposition of Arctic soil carbon, but few controlled experiments have manipulated the entire active layer. To determine surface-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane under anticipated end-of-century warming, here we used heating rods to warm (by 3.8 °C) to the depth of permafrost in polygonal tundra in Utqia?vik (formerly Barrow), Alaska and measured fluxes over two growing seasons. We show that ecosystem respiration is ~30% higher in warmed plots than in control plots (0.99 μmol m-2 s-1 versus 0.67 μmol m-2 s-1, p < 0.0001, n = 79). Additionally, the observed temperature sensitivity (Q10 of 2.8) is higher than that imposed for soil in Earth system models or reported by arctic experiments warming only the surface. A shoulder-season warming experiment revealed that rapid snow melt, which is becoming a more common event, can result in large methane emissions that may have otherwise been oxidized to carbon dioxide. Thus, warming promotes greenhouse gas emissions from the whole, deepening active layer and may contribute to climate change amplification.\n\nAccelerated Permafrost Thaw Linked to Rising River Temperature and Widening Channels, Zhao & Li, Geophysical Research Letters:\n\nRiver-controlled permafrost dynamics are crucial for sediment transport, infrastructure stability, and carbon cycle, yet are not well understood under climate change. Leveraging remotely sensed datasets, in-situ hydrological observations, and physics-based models, we reveal overall warming and widening rivers across the Tibetan Plateau in recent decades, driving accelerated sub-river permafrost thaw. River temperature of a representative section (Tuotuohe River) on the central Tibetan Plateau, has increased notably (0.39°C/decade) from 1985 to 2017, facilitating heat transfer into the underlying permafrost via both convection and conduction. Consequently, the permafrost beneath rivers warms faster (0.37°C-0.66°C/decade) and has a ∼0.5 m thicker active layer than non-inundated permafrost (0.17°C-0.49°C/decade). With increasing river discharge, the inundated area expands laterally along the riverbed (16.4 m/decade), further accelerating permafrost thaw for previously non-inundated bars. Under future warmer and wetter climate, the anticipated intensification of sub-river permafrost degradation will pose risks to riverine infrastructure and amplify permafrost carbon release.\n\nOn the economic feasibility of tidal range power plants, Pappas et al., Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Science:\n\nThe potential energy associated with tides presents a sustainable energy resource that remains largely untapped. Uncertainties on the economic case of tidal range power plants are a known obstacle. Research on tidal range structures suggests energy yield may be maximized through operation strategy optimization, and that impacts can be mitigated through design optimization. While instructive, these perspectives alone are insufficient to support the feasibility of individual projects. We integrate operation optimization and hydrodynamic impact analyses within a cost evaluation framework for tidal range structures focusing on capital costs (CAPEX) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Once benchmarked against 11 historic proposal cost projections, we perform a redesign of 18 tidal power plants to deliver a comprehensive comparative basis across a diverse range of sites in the UK. Tidal power plant operation is simulated in regional shallow-water equation models, acknowledging tide variability. The cost evaluation framework demonstrates the impact of geospatial variations on key cost components. The redesign process indicates transformative implications in that equivalent and lower LCOE values can be achieved for designs at a substantially lower CAPEX. Given how the latter hinder development, we show how tidal range schemes could be far more economically feasible than commonly perceived.\n\nRethinking the \"Levelized Cost of Energy\": A critical review and evaluation of the concept, Emblemsvåg, Energy Research & Social Science:\n\nThe changing language and sentiment of conversations about climate change in Reddit posts over sixteen years, Fariello & Jemielniak, Communications Earth & Environment:\n\nHere, we analyze 16 years of Reddit discussions, encompassing 11.5 billion posts, to examine how language surrounding climate change has evolved over time from 2005 to 2021. We applied sentiment analysis, polarity, subjectivity, and readability metrics to discussions of \"global warming\" and \"climate change\". We found that the use of \"climate change\" surpassed \"global warming\" in 2013, with \"climate change\" associated with more negative sentiment and higher subjectivity. Additionally, we observed a decline in the proportion of climate-related discussions over time despite the increasing total number of posts. These findings suggest that public engagement with climate topics on Reddit is waning, and the choice of terminology significantly influences the tone and complexity of the discourse. Our results have important implications for how climate issues are communicated and perceived by the public.\n\nReversal of the impact chain for actionable climate information, Pfleiderer et al., Nature Geoscience:\n\nEscalating impacts of climate change underscore the risks posed by crossing potentially irreversible Earth and socioecological system thresholds and adaptation limits. However, limitations in the provision of actionable climate information may hinder an anticipatory response. Here we suggest a reversal of the traditional impact chain methodology as an end-user focused approach linking specific climate risk thresholds, including at the local level, to emissions pathways. We outline the socioeconomic and value judgement dimensions that can inform the identification of such risk thresholds. The applicability of the approach is highlighted by three examples that estimate the required CO2 emissions constraints to avoid critical levels of health-related heat risks in Berlin, fire weather in Portugal and glacier mass loss in High Mountain Asia. We argue that linking risk threshold exceedance directly to global emissions benchmarks can aid the understanding of the benefits of stringent emissions reductions for societies and local decision-makers.\n\nFueling the crisis. Climate consequences of the 2021 infrastructure law, Salerno et al., Transporation for America\n\nIn November 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) into law. The IIJA included a five-year transportation authorization for U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) programs, plus a standalone infrastructure law representing the largest-ever infusion ($643 billion over five years) of federal funding for surface transportation, including highways, roads, and bridges. The White House hailed the IIJA as \"a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation's infrastructure and competitiveness,\" along with making lofty promises that it would \"repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all users.\" Three years into this investment of infrastructure dollars, has that turned out to be the case? The authors extrapolate that states' federal formula-funded investments made over the course of the IIJA could cumulatively increase emissions by nearly 190 million metric tonnes of emissions over baseline levels through 2040 from added driving. This is the emission equivalent of 500 natural gas-fired power plants or nearly 50 coal-fired power plants running for a year.\"\n\nEurope's state of water 2024. The need for improved water resilience, European Environment Agency\n\nEurope's water is under significant pressure, presenting serious challenges to water security, now and in the future. As such, Europe urgently needs to improve its resilience and ensure sustainable freshwater supplies for people and the environment. Water stress is already occurring in Europe. It affects 20% of Europe's territory and 30% of the population every year, figures that are likely to increase in the future due to climate change. As climate change unfolds in Europe, managing flood risk affordably and sustainably will become increasingly important.

Climate consequences of the 2021 infrastructure law, Salerno et al., Transporation for America\n\nIn November 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) into law. The IIJA included a five-year transportation authorization for U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) programs, plus a standalone infrastructure law representing the largest-ever infusion ($643 billion over five years) of federal funding for surface transportation, including highways, roads, and bridges. The White House hailed the IIJA as \"a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation's infrastructure and competitiveness,\" along with making lofty promises that it would \"repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all users.\" Three years into this investment of infrastructure dollars, has that turned out to be the case? The authors extrapolate that states' federal formula-funded investments made over the course of the IIJA could cumulatively increase emissions by nearly 190 million metric tonnes of emissions over baseline levels through 2040 from added driving. This is the emission equivalent of 500 natural gas-fired power plants or nearly 50 coal-fired power plants running for a year.\"\n\nEurope's state of water 2024. The need for improved water resilience, European Environment Agency\n\nEurope's water is under significant pressure, presenting serious challenges to water security, now and in the future. As such, Europe urgently needs to improve its resilience and ensure sustainable freshwater supplies for people and the environment. Water stress is already occurring in Europe. It affects 20% of Europe's territory and 30% of the population every year, figures that are likely to increase in the future due to climate change. As climate change unfolds in Europe, managing flood risk affordably and sustainably will become increasingly important. Intense rainfall has already increased in parts of Europe, leading to floods and growing flood risks. Flooding affects human well-being and ecosystems, with potential loss of life and significant economic losses.\n\nGuidance on incorporating building and transportation electrification into long-term load forecasts, Murphy et al., Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory\n\nThe authors present a framework to develop long-term electricity load forecasts that account for the impacts of building and transportation electrification. The framework identifies key modeling decisions and provides examples from recent Berkeley Lab technical assistance to two municipal utilities: Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and Fort Collins Utilities. For each step of the framework, the authors provide guiding questions, suggestions, and examples from Berkeley Lab technical assistance projects.\n\nKernspaltung, Erdgas, Geothermie, Kernfusion Welche Rolle spielen Grundlastkraftwerke in Zukunft?

Sind diese Art Kraftwerke für eine sichere Energieversorgung notwendig? Wie würden sie die Gesamtkosten der Energieversorgung beeinflussen? Und wie würden sie das Energiesystem verändern?\n\nThe authors analyzed whether and to what extent it is beneficial for the German and European energy supply to use baseload power plants in a restructured energy system. The experts also consider the following questions: What characterizes a baseload power plant? What technologies are suitable for low-CO2 baseload power plants? Are these types of power plants necessary for a secure energy supply? How would they affect the overall costs of energy supply? And how would they change the energy system?\n\nRecycling Wind Energy Systems in the United States, Christoffel et al., National Renewable Energy Labopratory\n\nthe authors performed a comprehensive life cycle and techno-economic assessment of end-of-life management pathways of U.S. wind turbines and systems.

It is a time of celebration, feasting, and family gatherings, with special dishes made from the season's harvest. The harvest of rice, sugarcane, and other crops marks this time, and many delicious dishes are prepared using these fresh ingredients.\n\nPopular Sankranti Dishes\n\nSankranti is known for its mouth-watering traditional dishes such as Bobbatlu, Bellam Gavvalu, Ariselu, Kajjikaayalu, Sakinalu, and Sunnundalu. These dishes are made using rice flour and jaggery, which are easy to find during the harvest season.\n\nFor many, the preparation of these dishes brings back cherished childhood memories. \"These special foods are often made outdoors, using a three-stone stove fueled by wood. We cook large quantities to share with relatives, and some is saved for later. It's always a joy for the children to watch the elaborate preparations,\" says Kanaka Durga, a homemaker from Hyderabad.\n\nHere's a list of some of the most popular Sankranti dishes:\n\nSakinalu\n\nSakinalu is a traditional dish made with rice flour and sesame seeds, which are abundant in Telangana. The preparation of Sakinalu is an art. The batter is poured into a cloth, and the cook twists their fingers in a special movement to form the dish. It has a unique flavor and is a must-have in every Telangana household during Sankranti. If stored properly, Sakinalu can last for up to two months.\n\nAriselu\n\nAriselu is a popular dish in Andhra Pradesh made from rice flour and jaggery. It requires a lot of skill to prepare, as the rice flour needs to be mixed in a specific way to create a smooth batter. It's a staple dish in Andhra homes during Sankranti.\n\nBobbatlu\n\nBobbatlu is a beloved dish made from chana dal, wheat, maida flour, and jaggery. It is popular in Andhra, Telangana, and Rayalaseema regions. The dish has different names depending on the region, such as Bobbatlu in Andhra and Bakshalu in Rayalaseema.\n\nKajjikayalu\n\nKajjikayalu is a traditional sweet made from a crispy outer shell filled with a smooth, sweet powdery filling. The filling varies depending on the region. In Telangana, sesame seeds are used, while in Rayalaseema, peanuts are used, and in Andhra, coconut powder is often the key ingredient.\n\nBellam Gavvalu\n\nBellam Gavvalu is a sweet dish made from flour (either all-purpose or wheat flour) and a concentrated jaggery mix. It is crunchy and can be stored for months. This dish is particularly loved by children.\n\nSunnundalu\n\nSunnundalu is made from roasted urad dal that is ground into a fine powder and mixed with jaggery. The mixture is then formed into laddus with ghee.

These estimates are not the final payment rates, which will be established by USDA in the next few months.\n\n\"Ad hoc federal aid contained in the American Relief Act of 2025 will help farmers by partially offsetting losses and reducing the erosion of their financial positions resulting from lower commodity prices and continuing high costs,\" according to a Jan. 7 farmdoc article. \"As such, many farmers and lenders will welcome it. The economic aid will make financial planning and loan renewal easier for the 2025 production year.\"\n\nEconomic losses are defined as the difference between expected production costs and expected gross returns for 2024. Expected production costs are taken from projections provided by USDA's Economic Research Service, while expected gross returns are defined as the product of the most recent price forecast for the 2024 marketing year available at the time of enactment of the bill (for most major field crops this would come from the December 2024 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report) and a national average yield over the most recent 10 years.\n\nPer-acre payment rates are defined as the greater of 26% of a commodity's estimated economic loss or a minimum payment rate. Minimum payment rates are defined as 8% of the product of a commodity's statutory reference price as outlined in the 2014 farm bill and its national average Price Loss Coverage payment yield.\n\nThe estimated payment rates for major field crops range from $21.76 for barley to $87.26 for cotton.\n\nThe economic assistance is expected to significantly reduce losses for 2024, but returns for an average cash rent farm could still be in the red.\n\nThe most recent Revenue and Costs for Illinois Grain Crops publication notes average net farmer returns on high-productivity land in central Illinois, after paying an average cash rent of $339 per acre, are negative $161 per acre for corn and negative $53 per acre for soybeans. Adding the economic assistance payments for corn and soybean improves returns but they remain below breakeven -- negative $118 per acre farmer return for corn and negative $23 per acre for soybeans. A farm with 50% of its acres in corn and 50% in soybeans would have a negative $71-per-acre farmer return averaged across the two crops.\n\n\"A negative $71-per-acre farmer return is historically low,\" the farmdoc report states.\n\nAccording to the Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center at the University of Missouri, total national assistance across the selected commodities is projected at $9.7 billion. Texas is at the top with an estimated $963 million in assistance, with Illinois estimated to receive $790 million.\n\nThe legislation also states eligible acres are determined as all planted acres for harvest, grazing, haying, silage or other similar purposes for the 2024 crop year plus 50% of prevented planted acres in 2024. Payments, which will be handled by Farm Service Agency and are expected to be made in the first part of the year, will be capped at $125,000, but that could increase to $250,000 for farmers who received 75% or more of their gross income from farming for the 2020-2022 tax years.\n\nThe maximum number of payment acres of corn, soybeans and wheat to reach the $125,000 limit using the farmdoc payment estimates are: corn, 2,941 acres; soybeans, 4,236 acres and wheat, 4,073 acres.\n\n\"As always, federal responses have unintended consequences. This economic aid will likely slow the cost adjustments that need to occur given current commodity price levels. For example, the economic assistance could make landowners less inclined to lower cash rents. Similarly, input suppliers may see reduced pressures to lower input prices,\" the farmdoc article states. \"Our projections for 2025 show continuing low returns. If commodity prices do not increase in 2025, we are likely to see calls for further ad hoc disaster assistance at the end of the year.\"\n\nThe American Relief Act of 2025 was signed by the president on Dec. 21, and funds federal agencies through March 14, provides $21 billion in disaster relief appropriations as well as the $10 billion for economic assistance to farmers, and extends the farm bill to Sept. 30.","source":{"uri":"farmweeknow.com","dataType":"blog","title":"FarmWeek Now"},"authors":[{"uri":"tammie_sloup_farmweek@farmweeknow.com","name":"Tammie Sloup FarmWeek","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/farmweeknow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/77/777cf6ae-cde8-11ef-9a1e-9740163a2bff/677ed6950f95c.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.003921568627450966,"wgt":474104342,"relevance":96},{"uri":"8492250660","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"07:33:37","dateTime":"2025-01-09T07:33:37Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T07:32:53Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6117647290229797,"url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss/weight-loss-tips-an-extra-10-gram-of-this-nutrient-can-help-in-weight-loss/articleshow/117077051.cms","title":"An extra 10 gram of THIS nutrient can help in weight loss: Expert - Times of India","body":"Weight loss is a tough journey; almost every individual who has embarked on this journey at least once in life will definitely agree to this. From consistency to diet, everything needs to be in the right proportion if you are planning to lose weight. Even if an iota of the effort goes out of the way the entire result collapses.\n\nDiet plays a key role in deciding whether you can lose weight or not or even if you lose it whether you can maintain it for a long time.\n\nOf all the nutrients that our body needs on a daily basis to maintain several functions, fibre plays a central role; though unfortunately it is ignored in the diet.\n\nDietary fiber, commonly referred to as fiber, is a type of carbohydrate found in plant-based foods that the body cannot digest. Unlike other carbohydrates, fiber passes through the digestive system relatively intact, providing various health benefits.\n\nThere are two main types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber dissolves in water, forming a gel-like substance that helps lower cholesterol and regulate blood sugar levels. Foods like oats, fruits, and legumes are rich in soluble fiber. Insoluble fiber, found in whole grains, nuts, and vegetables, adds bulk to stool, promoting healthy digestion and preventing constipation.\n\nMost people have a daily fibre gap of around 10 grams a day\n\nA normal adult should consume atleast 30 grams of fibre in a day.\n\n\"We're supposed to eat 30 grams of fibre a day, yet only one in 10 UK adults actually manage to consume that quantity,\" Dr Binita Kalaria, told the Mirror UK. \"Most people have a significant daily 'fibre gap' of around 10 grams a day,\" the GP added.\n\nThis highlights the lack of a balanced diet and how this unintentionally impacts the weight of youngsters mostly, who rely on processed foods.\n\n\"This means people don't prioritise high fibre foods because they don't know about the benefits or can't recognise the best fibre sources when they're in the supermarket,\" adds Dr Kalaria. \"But, with a bit of planning, it's simple to plug the fibre gap.\"\n\nHere's how you can add fibre to your daily diet\n\nSwap refined grains like white rice and maida (refined flour) with whole grains such as brown rice, whole wheat, millets (bajra, ragi), and quinoa. Start your day with fiber-packed options like oats or daliya (broken wheat) porridge.\n\nLentils (dal), chickpeas (chana), kidney beans (rajma), and black-eyed peas (lobia) are excellent sources of fiber. Include them in meals through dals, curries, or salads. Opt for sprouted lentils for added nutrition.\n\nIndian cooking naturally incorporates vegetables. Add fiber-rich options like spinach, carrots, beans, and pumpkin to your sabzis or stir-fries. Aim for a colorful plate to maximize nutrients.\n\nSnack on fresh fruits like guava, papaya, oranges, and apples. They provide both fiber and essential vitamins.\n\nInclude almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds in your diet as snacks or by sprinkling them over curd or salads.\n\nThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Patches of sandier soil showed damage to the alfalfa -- seen as darker areas in the field.\n\nA nasty dose of winter weather has pummeled much of the U.S. from Kansas to the East Coast, leaving many Americans to dig out of the blizzard -- including farmers. And more is on the way, with the polar air expected to continue to grip some places until at least Friday.\n\nFarmers always watch the weather, but depending on where they're located and what they produce, winter always presents mental challenges for growers, said Carolyn Olson, an organic farmer in southwestern Minnesota who is also vice president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors.\n\nProducers know that the timing and amount of winter moisture affect farming conditions for the rest of the year. It's also a time for planning ahead -- something becoming increasingly difficult as climate change ramps up variability in snowfall, rainfall and other weather conditions that can make or break an operation.\n\n\"They're doing that stressful part of making those decisions on how they're going to farm this year, what they're going to grow,\" Olson said. \"It's just a lot of pressure on agriculture at this time of the year.\"\n\nLivestock producers dealing with 'generational storm'\n\nBiting wind and big drifts from almost a whole year's average snowfall in a single storm are hitting farmers in some parts of Kansas \"in ways that we haven't seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a lifetime,\" said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State University who developed an animal comfort tool. It includes an index of heat and cold that a farmer can use -- along with their knowledge of their animals' age, coat, overall health and so forth -- to watch for situations when they may need to get animals out of dangerous areas.\n\nThe risk is real: Calves, especially, can die when temperatures slip below zero. And so much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from reaching herds with food and water, Redmond said.\n\nThat means preparing by moving animals and having a plan to care for them ahead of time is key -- which is harder due to the unpredictability of climate change. And not having the right experience or infrastructure to prepare is \"really, really stressful on producers,\" Redmond said.\n\nReprieve for some typically snowy areas\n\nThe storm missed some states further north like Iowa and Minnesota that are generally more accustomed to snow. Stu Swanson, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said that eases tasks like moving grain and working with livestock.\n\nHe added that without snow cover, the ground is more likely to freeze and thaw in a way that could benefit soils. Two years of drought followed by torrential rains last spring created tire ruts and compaction from farm machinery in some places, he said. He hopes that without as much snow, the freeze-thaw cycle will loosen up the soil and farmers may get the added bonus of some pests dying off before the spring.\n\n\"We don't have any growing crop now, so really temperature doesn't matter. We look forward to a good freeze,\" Swanson said.\n\nThe lack of snow is a greater concern farther north in some parts of Minnesota, where producers do have winter crops like alfalfa or winter wheat.\n\nReliable snow cover is important in those areas because it insulates soil from cold. A few of inches of snow on top of a field can keep winter wheat's crown (which is still underground this time of year to withstand the winter) at 28 degrees Fahrenheit even if the air temperature is as low as minus 40 Fahrenheit, said Jochum Wiersma, an extension professor at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\"There's not a lot you can do, unfortunately,\" when ice breaks a plant's crown, said Martin Larsen, who grows alfalfa in addition to other crops like corn in southeastern Minnesota. He's concerned about the long-term trends, too -- he pointed out last year's likely record warmth -- and said he noticed the lack of snow cover in his region then, too.\n\n\"We were so dry going into last spring and we were in the field almost a month before we normally do. I would say that concern exists this year as well,\" Larsen said.\n\nGary Prescher, who has been farming a small grain operation for about 50 years in south-central Minnesota, said he's noticed more variability over the past six to 10 years. That's changing his long-term philosophy on the farm. He said he wants to make sure his operation can handle more extreme weather events, and that excess heat, cold, dryness, wetness or wind have \"forced some changes out here for me and my neighbors.\"","source":{"uri":"marshallindependent.com","dataType":"news","title":"marshallindependent.com"},"authors":[],"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ogden_images/www.marshallindependent.com/images/2025/01/08191118/olson-copy-752x500.jpg","eventUri":"eng-10234673","sentiment":-0.207843137254902,"wgt":474103741,"relevance":46},{"uri":"2025-01-597430970","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"07:26:27","dateTime":"2025-01-09T07:26:27Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T07:22:01Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://leadership.ng/bua-foods-awards-dealers-n2-4bn-for-performance/","title":"BUA Foods Awards Dealers N2.4bn For Performance","body":"BUA Foods has rewarded its distributors N2.4 billion during its customer awards dinner for their contribution to the firm's growth.\n\n\"In line with its mission to create long-term value for all stakeholders, BUA Foods has recognised and awarded dealers of its IRS Premium Wheat Flour, for their support and loyalty to the company,\" BUA Foods said in a statement.\n\nThe firm stated that they were honored with awards and significant cash prizes amounting to a total of N2.4 billion. \"Among the winners were Yahuza Abdullahi from Kano state who won N454.6 million, Ashiru Ali Yamusa who won N284.1 million, and Maimuna Rabiu, who won N185.8 million.\"\n\nChairman of BUA Foods Abdul Rabiu, said the contributions of the distributors are transformative and invaluable to the company's growth strategy.\n\n\"Our growth is built on a foundation of partnership, trust, and collaboration.

This enhancement is involved in three vital ecosystem processes: (i) increasing crop silicon uptake in deep horizons where it is more readily available as Si(OH4), (ii) contributing to storing more stable organic carbon at depth via root decomposition and deep pedogenic pathways, and (iii) accelerating CO2 transformation into stored or leached alkalinity via deep silicate weathering.\n\nAgroecosystems, which cover nearly 40% of Earth's land surface, are dominant drivers of Earth's biogeochemical cycling and maintain the vital life-support systems to feed a growing global population via provisioning ecosystem services, such as food and fiber production. However, agroecosystem sustainable development is under threat due to multiple stresses of environmental and climatic changes such as warming, pest and disease, saline, drought and acidic constraints, and biodiversity loss. Moreover, state-of-the-art climate projections have predicted that the environmental and climatic changes would continuously increase the global intensification of heavy precipitation events and heat extremes and surfaces with stronger or longer-lasting droughts in agroecosystems.\n\nSilicon (Si) is beneficial for crops to maintain a sustainable and smart agroecosystem via alleviating various biotic and abiotic stresses (Fig. 1, Box A). Indeed, Si serves indirectly or directly to crop health, resilience, and food security (Fig. 1, Box A) to benefit humans. Particularly, globally cultivated crops contain 1% or more Si by dry weight, such as rice, wheat, corn, and sugarcane. Despite Si's critical importance under environmental and climatic stresses, its role in crops remains controversial. According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, Si is linked to agroecosystem service, as it has various beneficial roles immediately and finally serves humans. As illustrated by Fig. 1 (Box A), the Si-related agroecosystem service can be grouped into three categories: (i) supporting services (i.e., primary production, nutrient cycling, soil formation and protection), (ii) provisioning services (i.e., food and energy), and (iii) regulating services (i.e., pest control, crop pollination, climate and flood regulation, and water conservation). Consequently, enhancing plant Si uptake (i.e., silicification degree) improves crop productivity under environmental and climatic stresses. Deep rooting enhances the uptake of soil water and nutrients in the plant.\n\nNevertheless, little is known about whether and to what extent crop silicification can be improved by developing new varieties of deep-rooted crops to link Si agroecosystem services. These knowledge gaps severely limit our understanding and ability to predict the response of agroecosystem biogeochemistry and functions to crop silicification under environmental and climatic changes, lagging the implications of new crop silicification for science, management and governance of agroecosystems. Since the need for increased research attention on Si's beneficial roles in crops becomes clearer and more urgent, closing these long-neglected knowledge gaps may be a top priority for scientists and decision-makers alike in the sustainable development of agroecosystems.\n\nHere, we discuss whether and to what extent Si-related agroecosystem processes are enhanced by developing new crop varieties with increased root biomass and deep rooting, particularly in the face of intensifying environmental and climatic changes. The agroecosystem processes are involved in (i) taking up more Si in deep horizons where it is more readily available as Si(OH), responding to crop improvement; (ii) contributing to storing more stable organic carbon at depth via root decomposition and deep pedogenic pathways, and (iii) transforming CO into the stored alkalinity or leached alkalinity via boosting primary silicate weathering. These major ecosystem processes are closely involved in vital agroecosystem services: soil and water conservation, climate change mitigation, crop protection and food production. Finally, we propose how to measure or predict agroecosystem services by developing new varieties of deep-rooted crops based on the knowledge of the links between Si mobility and the mentioned agroecosystem processes and services.","source":{"uri":"nature.com","dataType":"news","title":"Nature"},"authors":[],"image":"https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44264-024-00045-x/MediaObjects/44264_2024_45_Fig1_HTML.png","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.1529411764705881,"wgt":474102862,"relevance":18},{"uri":"8492224890","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"07:13:33","dateTime":"2025-01-09T07:13:33Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T07:12:46Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-85606-x","title":"Chemical composition and insecticidal activity of Mentha rotundifolia and Chrysanthemum coronarium essential oils against the tomato leaf miner, Tuta absoluta - Scientific Reports","body":"The EOs yields obtained in the steam distillation were 0.70 and 0.20% for the M. rotundifolia and C. couronarium, respectively. The resulting vegetable extractions produced yellowish EOs with a strong and persistent odor.\n\nA variation in EO yields was observed between species (Table 2). The quantity of M. rotundifoliaEO obtained in our study is higher than that (0.49%) obtained byfor the same species treated by hydro-distillation from Bejaia (Algeria). Higher values have been reported in various studies in other Algerian locations. The yield of mint leaves EO from Khemis Meliana is around 1.8%. Meanwhile, samples from the Sétif region showed a rate of 1.27%. Meanwhile, those from the El Tarf region yielded 1.65%. M. rotundifoliacollected in Tunisia yielded 1.26%. However, mint from Morocco was characterized by a yield of 1.17%.\n\nFor C. couronarium, the leaves from the Mostaganem region showed a lower yield than in studies conducted in different parts of the world. In Tunisia, the study conducted by on C. couronariumoil noted a content of 0.31%. Nevertheless, the EO yields of this plant harvested from two regions in Cyprus, Değirmenlik and Salamis, were around 0.44 and 0.40%, respectively. Furthermore, the study by obtained the following yields from samples from Greece: 0.31% (Porto Rafti) and 0.39% (Diminio).\n\nThe difference in the number of EOs observed in M. rotundifolia and C. couronariummay be linked to several factors, including the plant family and biology, environmental conditions, climatic and edaphic factors related to geographical location, physiological variations, harvesting period, plant organ, temperature, drying time and extraction method.\n\nThe GC-MS analysis of the dry leaves of M. rotundifolia EOs revealed the presence of 77 compounds, representing 98.19% of the total composition of the oil. The majority component was Cyclobutaneacetonitrile, 1-methyl-2-(1methylethenyl)- (45.60%), followed by terpinene-4-ol (6.36%), p-menthane (5.46%), germacrene D (4.49%), Caryophyllene (2.29%), and myrcene (3.04%) (Table 3).\n\nMany studies have examined the chemical components of M. rotundifoliaEOs growing in different parts of the world, and distinct chemotypes have been identified. M. rotundifoliaharvested in northeast Algeria was studied. Samples from Bejaia reported trans-piperine epoxide (30.2%), piperine oxide (8.7%), thymol (4.5%), germacrene D (3.5%), and terpinene-4-ol (2.7%) as the main ingredients. In contrast, chemical analyses of the oil of the same species grown in Annaba revealed that the major compounds are carvacrol (60.54%), pulegone (5.95%), m-cymene (5.25%) and γ-terpinene (4.83%). However, the characterization of M. rotundifoliaoil from eastern Algeria (Batna) revealed a different composition with piperitenone oxide (35.49%) as the main component, followed by caryophyllene oxide (35.27%) and cis-cinerolone (10.95%). According to, 3-cyclopenten-1-one and 2-hydroxy-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)- (89.09%) are the essential molecules of M. rotundifolia oil from Sétif.\n\nIn contrast, analyzed the Tunisian species. They found that there was a difference in chemical composition between the Béja region (north-west Tunisia), where caryophyllene (26.67%) was considered the marginal substance followed by germacrene D (12.31%) and carveol (7.38%). Samples from Bizerte (north-east Tunisia) contained pulegone (32.9%), piperitenone oxide (17.28%), and 5-acetyl thiazole (11.26%). For those from Morocco, the most dominant component is 2 iso-propylidenecyclohexanone at 11.99%, followed by eucarvone at 11.42%, gamma-murolene at 8.61%, 2-Isopropyl-5-methyl-3-cyclohexen-1-one (6.83%) and p-menthan-1,2,3-triol (6.72%). In other reports, the main compound of the species studied is pulegone (85%).\n\nThe chemical analysis of C. coronarium EOs allowed the identification of 69 compounds, representing approximately 95.39% of the total oil. The main substances were farnesene (10.19%), myrcene (10.12%), eugenol (7.97%), germacrene D (6.34%), phytol (4.88%), and pinene (3.66%) (Table 4).\n\nIn Morocco, researchers analyzed the aerial part of C. coronariumEOs obtained by hydrodistillation using GC/MS. The results indicated the presence of chrysanthenone (17.02%), camphor (15.38%), and pulegone (20.68%). Our oil's chemical profile differs from those previously reported. studied the Tunisian species and found that cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (21.82%), trans-chrysanthenyl acetate (12.78%), (E)-β-farnesene (8.97%), germacrene D (8.92%), and camphor (6.03%) are essential elements.\n\nHowever, the main component of C. coronarium oil from Jordan was camphor (17.5%) followed by santolin triene (4.3%), neoiso-3-thujanol (5.6%), cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (10.8%), perilla aldehyde (11.7%), isoitalicene (4.7%) and phenylpropyl butanoate (4.9%). High concentrations of santolinatriene, yomogi alcohol, camphor, cis-chrysanthenyl acetate, and bornyl acetate were found in oils extracted from the aerial sections of C. couronariumplants in Cyprus. On the other hand, studied the chemical composition of flower heads from two locations in Greece. While samples from Diminio contained trans-chrysanthenyl acetate (13.2%), trans-chrysanthenyl isovalerate (10.2%), and cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (9.9%), those from Porto Rafti were rich in trans-chrysanthenyl acetate (7.8%), cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (9.1%) and camphor (15.7%). However, the species that are native to South Korea contain myrcene (31.9%), -bisabolol (16.5%), (E, E)-farnesene (11%), and (E)-farnesene (8.4%) as major constituents.\n\nThe observed composition discrepancy between the plants' essential oils and those documented by previous investigations is probably associated with intrinsic factors, such as species, chemotype/genotype, genetic structures, organogenesis, and development phases. Geographical variation, plant parameters (e.g., species, cultivated or wild plants), harvesting and post-harvest/predistillation parameters (e.g., harvesting season, biomass pre-treatment and storage), production conditions, storage conditions, and oil storage time EOs are additional factors that can affect the chemical composition of oils.\n\nThe toxicity of M. rotundifolia oil to T. absoluta larvae was demonstrated. Mortality rates ranging from 7.01 to 38.58% were observed 24 h after application. After 4 days, the various concentrations of peppermint oil resulted in mortality rates ranging from 46.15 to 84.8%. On the seventh day of the experiment, peppermint oil achieved 86.20% mortality at the highest concentration (50 µl/ml). Meanwhile, 65.51%, 66.65%, 82.18%, and 83.32% mortality rates were observed with 10, 20, 30, and 40 µl/ml concentrations, respectively (Fig. 01).\n\nThe mortality rate of T. absoluta caterpillars varied highly significantly (P < 0.001) among different concentrations of M. rotundifolia oil and control groups (positive and negative) (Fig. 02).\n\nThe toxicity of C. couronarium EO against T. absoluta caterpillars was remarkable. After 24 h of oil application, larval mortalities ranged from 5.35 to 19.64. However, mortality rates of 46.5% and 65.57% were caused by the lowest (10 µl/ml) and highest concentration (50 µl/ml), respectively, four (04) days later.\n\nOn the seventh day of the test, the highest concentration (50%) caused 82.91% mortality, while 10 and 20 µl/ml concentrations caused 61.29% mortality (Fig. 03).\n\nThe variance analysis conducted on the larvae's mortality, based on the concentrations of the EO of the C. couronarium and the controls, yielded highly significant results (P < 0.001). The highest mortality was observed in the highest concentration for all developmental stages of T. absoluta. Additionally, the results revealed that the 1st and 2nd larval instars were more sensitive than the 3rd and 4th instars (Fig. 04).\n\nThe analysis of variance for the insecticidal effect EOs on T. absoluta larvae did not show any significant difference (P > 0.05) for both the concentration and oil factors. The larvae were sensitive to the toxicity of the essential oils, even at the lowest concentration (10 µl/ml) (Fig. 05).\n\nAfter seven days of exposure to M. rotundifolia EO to T. absoluta larvae, the calculated LC was 2.88 µl/ml, and the LC obtained was equal to 54.95 µl/ml. In contrast, the LC and LC values obtained for C. couronarium oil are 1.07 µl/ml and 17.37 µl/ml, respectively.\n\nOne day after spraying, significant mortality of TLM caterpillars was observed. However, live individuals moved more slowly before stopping feeding. The caterpillars then became discoloured, desiccated, and died a few days later. The insecticidal effect of EOs against T. absolutalarvae could be explained by the high content of the major volatile components of the plant's essential oil. It may also be due to certain minority constituents or to a synergistic effect of several constituents. reports that monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and phenylpropanoids are among the main constituents of several botanical EOs that are important for their effects on insect pests. Indeed, several studies have explored the effectiveness of the EOs from certain species of Menthaas insecticides. The results obtained in our research are consistent with a previous study that highlighted the high toxicity of the EOs of this genus against various insect species. In contrast, the toxicity of M. rotundifoliaEOs at different concentrations was tested against adult wheat weevils and red flour beetles. It was found that the mortality rate was influenced by several factors, including insect species and exposure duration. However, the in-vitro test showed that the essential oil had insecticidal activity against fourth-instar Culex pipiens larvae.\n\nOn the other hand, various research studies have also demonstrated the insecticidal activity of the EOs of C. couronarium. The application of C. coronarium oil to the nymphs of the stored product pest Tribolium confusumcaused significant mortality, which reached 67% after 7 days of treatment. Also, the study conducted by showed the insecticidal effect of this oil on individuals of Sitophilus granarius.\n\nAs with other insect pests, the most developed botanical insecticides against T. absolutahave been formulated with EOs. Several studies investigating essential oils' lethal and/or sublethal effects (e.g., on behaviour) have demonstrated insecticidal efficacy against TLM. The impact of ajwain essential oils (Trachyspermum ammi) on T. absolutalarvae in their fourth instar was studied. The study determined each compound's effectiveness and whether it was antagonistic or synergistic. The findings indicated that thymol and ajwain EOs had the maximum toxicity against larvae.\n\ninvestigated the biocidal activity of thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and citronella (Cymbopogon citratus) EOs against the pest T. absoluta. The results showed that both oils had similar extermination and insecticidal efficacy by direct contact and fumigation. Both prolonged the life cycle of the pest. Furthermore, Syzygium aromaticumbud essential oil showed high insecticidal toxicity against TLM larvae under laboratory conditions. On the other hand, showed good insecticidal activity of citrus EOs with contact mortality on T. absoluta eggs and larvae.\n\nThe insecticidal activity of EOs is promising; however, their application in real-world scenarios presents challenges related to resistance development and environmental limitations. Repeated exposure to sub-lethal doses of EOs may lead to behavioral or physiological resistance in pest populations, akin to resistance seen with synthetic insecticides. This is particularly concerning if EOs act on specific molecular targets, as pests can evolve mechanisms to counteract these effects. Furthermore, the volatility and susceptibility of essential oils to environmental degradation, such as oxidation or UV light exposure, limit their efficacy in outdoor applications. Their short residual activity necessitates frequent reapplications, which can increase costs and labor demands. Additionally, EOs are often non-specific, potentially affecting beneficial insects like pollinators and predators, which could disrupt ecological balance. The economic feasibility of large-scale EO production and regulatory hurdles also pose significant barriers to widespread pest management adoption. These limitations highlight the need to integrate EOs into broader pest control strategies, combining them with other methods to mitigate resistance and optimize efficacy.\n\nFarmers are advised to use EOs products alone and with other biorational options, such as predatory arthropods and microbial pesticides. However, several limitations exist, such as optimized and approved formulations, for practically incorporating essential oils into IPM programs. In addition, the compatibility of EOs with effective biological control agents needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. These reasons, as well as cost, efficacy, and reliability, may hinder growers' use of this control option.","source":{"uri":"nature.com","dataType":"news","title":"Nature"},"authors":[],"image":"https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-85606-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_85606_Fig1_HTML.png","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.1215686274509804,"wgt":474102813,"relevance":21},{"uri":"2025-01-597418508","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"07:11:32","dateTime":"2025-01-09T07:11:32Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T07:11:10Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.6509804129600525,"url":"https://www.fibre2fashion.com/news/textile-news/ice-cotton-further-weakens-on-stronger-dollar-sluggish-demand-300088-newsdetails.htm","title":"ICE cotton further weakens on stronger dollar, sluggish demand","body":"Yesterday, the ICE cotton March 2025 contract settled at 68.23 cents per pound (0.453 kg), down by 0.28 cents.

These dishes are made using rice flour and jaggery, which are easy to find during the harvest season.\n\nFor many, the preparation of these dishes brings back cherished childhood memories. \"These special foods are often made outdoors, using a three-stone stove fueled by wood. We cook large quantities to share with relatives, and some is saved for later. It's always a joy for the children to watch the elaborate preparations,\" says Kanaka Durga, a homemaker from Hyderabad.\n\nHere's a list of some of the most popular Sankranti dishes:\n\nSakinalu\n\nSakinalu is a traditional dish made with rice flour and sesame seeds, which are abundant in Telangana. The preparation of Sakinalu is an art. The batter is poured into a cloth, and the cook twists their fingers in a special movement to form the dish. It has a unique flavor and is a must-have in every Telangana household during Sankranti. If stored properly, Sakinalu can last for up to two months.\n\nAriselu\n\nAriselu is a popular dish in Andhra Pradesh made from rice flour and jaggery. It requires a lot of skill to prepare, as the rice flour needs to be mixed in a specific way to create a smooth batter. It's a staple dish in Andhra homes during Sankranti.\n\nBobbatlu\n\nBobbatlu is a beloved dish made from chana dal, wheat, maida flour, and jaggery. It is popular in Andhra, Telangana, and Rayalaseema regions. The dish has different names depending on the region, such as Bobbatlu in Andhra and Bakshalu in Rayalaseema.\n\nKajjikayalu\n\nKajjikayalu is a traditional sweet made from a crispy outer shell filled with a smooth, sweet powdery filling. The filling varies depending on the region. In Telangana, sesame seeds are used, while in Rayalaseema, peanuts are used, and in Andhra, coconut powder is often the key ingredient.\n\nBellam Gavvalu\n\nBellam Gavvalu is a sweet dish made from flour (either all-purpose or wheat flour) and a concentrated jaggery mix. It is crunchy and can be stored for months. This dish is particularly loved by children.\n\nSunnundalu\n\nSunnundalu is made from roasted urad dal that is ground into a fine powder and mixed with jaggery.

Truth is, I was already pulling up my phone to Google it under the desk. After years of random hives, sneezing fits, and that one scary restaurant reaction, I just wanted answers. Maybe you're in the same boat right now, staring at your test results and wondering what all these numbers mean for your life.\n\nWhat is an IgE Blood Test?\n\nPicture your immune system as an overenthusiastic bouncer at a club. IgE antibodies are like the security cameras helping that bouncer decide what's actually a threat. Sometimes they get it wrong and start throwing out perfectly good customers (like that piece of shrimp that just wanted to be dinner).\n\nDuring my first allergist visit, she sketched out how these antibodies work on the examination table paper. \"Your body creates specific IgE antibodies for things it thinks are dangerous,\" she explained, drawing little Y-shaped figures. \"The more it makes, the stronger it thinks the threat is.\" That explanation made way more sense than the medical websites I'd been browsing at 3 AM.\n\nTypes of IgE Testing Methods\n\nMy test results showed up in my patient portal on a Tuesday morning. Great. Now I just needed my ige blood test results explained to me. Thanks to LabAnalyzer, I didn't have to wait for my follow-up appointment to make sense of them. Here's what I learned about the two main ways doctors track down allergy culprits:\n\nTotal IgE Testing\n\nThis test is like taking inventory of all your body's security cameras at once. A high number means your immune system is definitely reacting to something, but not exactly what. My friend Jake's total IgE was through the roof, which explained why he sneezed his way through every season - his bouncer was working overtime.\n\nSpecific IgE Testing\n\nThis is where things get interesting. These tests check for reactions to specific triggers - like showing your immune system a lineup of suspects. My results showed high numbers for shrimp (goodbye, seafood buffets) and dust mites (hello, new air purifier).\n\nHow to Interpret Your IgE Test Results\n\nLooking at my raw test results felt like reading a foreign language. That's when I found LabAnalyzer, which translated all those mysterious numbers and units into actual English. Instead of panicking over a 3.2 kU/L reaction to dust mites, I learned this meant I should probably dust more than once a season (and maybe invest in some allergen-proof bedding).\n\nThe best part? Understanding these results before my follow-up appointment meant I could ask better questions. Instead of wasting time on \"what do these numbers mean?\" we jumped straight to \"what air purifier would work best in my bedroom?\"\n\nNormal vs. Abnormal IgE Levels\n\nHere's something that blew my mind: normal IgE levels are like shoe sizes - what's normal for one person might be way off for another. Kids typically have higher levels than adults. People with allergies or asthma usually run higher than those without.\n\nMy numbers looked scary high compared to the \"normal\" range, but my allergist wasn't concerned. \"We look at your symptoms more than the exact numbers,\" she said. \"Numbers help us confirm what's bothering you, but how you feel matters more than what the test says.\"\n\nCommon Allergens Detected Through IgE Testing\n\nWant to know what these tests can spot? Here's what I learned from my deep dive into allergy testing:\n\nFood Allergens They can check for reactions to: Shellfish (which solved my post-sushi mystery) Peanuts and tree nuts Milk and eggs Wheat (though gluten issues are a different story) Soy Fish\n\nI found out I'm only allergic to shellfish, not all seafood - which means I can still enjoy salmon sushi (just not next to the shrimp rolls).\n\nEnvironmental Allergens They also test for: Pet dander (my sister's cat sends her regards) Pollen (pine trees are my kryptonite) Dust mites (the real reason spring cleaning matters) Mold spores Grass When to Seek Additional Testing\n\nHere's what no one tells you about allergy testing: sometimes the first round of tests isn't the whole story. My cousin tested negative for everything but still got rashes. Turns out she had a rare reaction that didn't show up on standard tests. Consider more testing if:\n\nYour symptoms don't line up with your results You have clear reactions but your tests say you're fine Your reactions are getting worse You're developing new symptoms Your gut says something else is going on The Light at the End of the Tunnel\n\nGetting my IgE results was like finally finding the last pieces of a puzzle I'd been working on for years. All those random reactions suddenly made sense. No more wondering if I was just being dramatic about certain foods or if my spring sneezing was all in my head.\n\nUsing LabAnalyzer to understand my results before my follow-up appointment changed everything. Instead of sitting there confused while my doctor explained basic concepts, we spent our time making a real plan to deal with my allergies.\n\nThese days, I still carry my EpiPen (because shrimp happens), and I've learned to check restaurant menus ahead of time. My new air purifier keeps the dust mite drama to a minimum, and I actually understand what my allergy tests mean when I get updates.\n\nYour test results aren't just numbers on a screen - they're a map to feeling better. And with tools like LabAnalyzer, you don't need a medical degree to read that map. You just need the right guide to help you understand what those numbers mean for your daily life.\n\nRelated Items:Allergy Testing, IgE Blood Test","source":{"uri":"techbullion.com","dataType":"news","title":"TechBullion"},"authors":[{"uri":"angela_scott_briggs@techbullion.com","name":"Angela Scott-Briggs","type":"author","isAgency":false},{"uri":"miller_victor@techbullion.com","name":"Miller Victor","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IgE-Blood-Test.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.1529411764705881,"wgt":474102354,"relevance":12},{"uri":"b-8492201943","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"06:55:02","dateTime":"2025-01-09T06:55:02Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T06:54:31Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://www.editorji.com/world-news/india-and-afghan-taliban-government-hold-crucial-talks-in-dubai-1736404879070","title":"India and Afghan Taliban government hold crucial talks in Dubai","body":"A high-level meeting between senior Indian officials and the Afghan Taliban leadership took place in Dubai on Wednesday. Representing India was Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, while Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, the acting foreign minister of the Taliban government, represented Afghanistan.\n\nThis meeting is seen as a significant step in reviving and fostering bilateral ties, which have remained largely dormant since the Taliban's return to power in 2021. Despite limited engagement, New Delhi has continued providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.\n\nThe primary agenda of the Dubai meeting was to enhance cooperation across various sectors, including humanitarian aid, developmental assistance, trade, commerce, sports, cultural exchanges, regional security, and critical infrastructure projects.\n\nOne focal point of the discussions was the Chabahar Port in Iran, which serves as a strategic supply route for goods to Afghanistan. While India and Afghanistan share a land border, it has remained inaccessible due to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n\nCommitments and Support\n\nDuring the meeting, India pledged further humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, with priority placed on healthcare, medicine supply, and refugee rehabilitation. Over recent years, New Delhi has provided significant aid, including 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat, 300 tonnes of medicines, earthquake relief aid, vaccines, hygiene kits, and other essential supplies.\n\nThe Afghan foreign minister expressed gratitude for India's continued support and engagement with the Afghan people. India's Foreign Ministry reaffirmed its readiness to address the urgent developmental needs of Afghanistan. \"In view of the current need for development activities, it was decided that India would consider engaging in development projects in the near future,\" a statement from the ministry confirmed.\n\nRegional Security and Strategic Projects\n\nKabul assured India of its sensitivity to regional security concerns, emphasizing full cooperation on this front. A joint statement highlighted the agreement to further utilize Chabahar Port to support trade, commercial activities, and humanitarian aid delivery.\n\nForeign Secretary Misri also underscored India's deep-rooted cultural and historical ties with Afghanistan. \"The foreign secretary underlined India's historic friendship with the Afghan people and the strong people-to-people contacts between the two countries,\" noted the ministry.\n\nStrengthening Sporting Ties\n\nSports, particularly cricket -- a shared passion in both nations -- was also discussed during the talks. Both sides agreed to explore ways to strengthen their sporting connections.\n\nRegional Tensions and Pakistan's Airstrikes\n\nThe Dubai meeting followed India's strong condemnation of Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan earlier this week. On December 24, Pakistani airstrikes in Barmal district, Paktika province, killed 46 people, including women and children. This marked the second such strike in 2024, with a similar attack in March claiming eight lives, including children.\n\nIn response to the airstrikes, India issued a sharp statement: \"We unequivocally condemn any attack on innocent civilians. It is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures,\" said the foreign ministry.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe Taliban, a predominantly Pashtun group, refers to itself as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Initially forming a government in 1996, the Taliban was ousted in 2001 by the US-led coalition following the 9/11 attacks. However, in 2021, the group regained power after the abrupt withdrawal of US forces, establishing itself as the governing authority in Afghanistan.\n\nThis meeting in Dubai marks a key effort by India and Afghanistan to navigate complex geopolitical challenges while strengthening mutual cooperation in the region.","source":{"uri":"editorji.com","dataType":"blog","title":"Editorji"},"authors":[],"image":"https://cdn.editorji.com/lXEm2zfNdz.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.2392156862745098,"wgt":474101702,"relevance":16},{"uri":"b-8492191644","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"06:46:12","dateTime":"2025-01-09T06:46:12Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T06:45:46Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://medicalbuyer.co.in/india-ready-to-support-afghanistan-in-health-sector/","title":"India ready to support Afghanistan in health sector  - Medical Buyer","body":"India has expressed its readiness to respond to Afghanistan's urgent developmental needs, including support for the health sector, rehabilitation of refugees, and strengthening ties to promote sports, particularly cricket.

Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri met with Afghanistan's acting Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, with discussions centered on Afghanistan's urgent development needs and strengthening bilateral cooperation.\n\nDuring the meeting, Misri received an assurance from Muttaqi that Afghan territory would not be used against India, an important development in light of the security concerns that have shaped New Delhi's relations with Kabul since the Taliban's resurgence. This conversation represents a substantial upgrade from previous interactions, which had only seen Indian officials at the Joint Secretary level engage with Taliban ministers.\n\nIndian government reiterated its commitment to assisting Afghanistan's humanitarian and development needs. According to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), India will consider expanding its involvement in development projects alongside the ongoing humanitarian aid program. The two sides also agreed to enhance the use of the Chabahar Port, facilitating trade, commercial activities, and continued humanitarian support to Afghanistan.\n\nThis meeting took place amid escalating tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly over Pakistan Taliban activities and airstrikes carried out on Afghan soil. Afghanistan's relations with Islamabad have soured, particularly following Pakistan's airstrikes on Afghan territory, which killed 46 people, including women and children. India condemned these actions, asserting its solidarity with Afghanistan and criticizing Pakistan for its externalizing of internal security issues.\n\nIndia's long-standing friendship with the Afghan people was emphasized during the talks. Misri highlighted New Delhi's commitment to addressing Afghanistan's critical development needs. The two sides also discussed enhancing cultural and sports cooperation, especially in cricket, a popular sport among Afghanistan's youth. The meeting underscored the importance of continuing India's humanitarian support, which includes significant shipments of wheat, medicines, vaccines, earthquake relief materials, and other essential aid to Afghanistan.\n\nDespite not officially recognizing the Taliban government, India's engagement with Afghanistan comes as the Taliban's ties with Pakistan have become increasingly strained. Kabul's growing resentment toward Islamabad stems from allegations that Pakistan is using Afghan soil to harbor members of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a banned terrorist group targeting Pakistani civilians and security forces. Recent Pakistani military airstrikes against suspected TTP hideouts in Afghanistan only added to the tensions, with Kabul condemning the attacks that led to the deaths of numerous refugees.\n\nThe discussions in Dubai also included talks about India's continued support for the health sector in Afghanistan and the rehabilitation of refugees. In line with its ongoing assistance, India pledged further material support to address these critical sectors, continuing its role as a key humanitarian partner for Afghanistan despite the complexities of engaging with the Taliban.\n\nThe meeting signals a recalibration of India's foreign policy approach in the region, marking a shift towards pragmatic engagement with the Taliban amid changing geopolitical realities.","source":{"uri":"newsx.com","dataType":"news","title":"NewsX"},"authors":[{"uri":"sofia_babu@newsx.com","name":"Sofia Babu","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/taliban.webp","eventUri":"eng-10234566","sentiment":0.3176470588235294,"wgt":474100325,"relevance":15},{"uri":"2025-01-597384843","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"06:28:19","dateTime":"2025-01-09T06:28:19Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T06:13:17Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.7568627595901489,"url":"https://swarajyamag.com/news-brief/india-taliban-talks-in-dubai-chabahar-port-security-concerns-humanitarian-aid-and-development-plans-discussed","title":"India-Taliban Talks In Dubai: Chabahar Port, Security Concerns, Humanitarian Aid And Development Plans Discussed","body":"Bookmark stories for easy access on any device or the Swarajya app.\n\nIndia's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, met the Taliban's acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, in Dubai on Wednesday (8 January), marking the first officially acknowledged interaction at this level.\n\nThe meeting is part of India's ongoing outreach to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which New Delhi does not formally recognise.\n\nDuring the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed its \"sensitivities to India's security concerns\", according to a statement from External Affairs Ministry.\n\nIndia has long-standing concerns about the presence of Pakistan-based terror groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), operating in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Indian delegation has previously urged the Taliban to prevent Afghan soil from being used by anti-India elements.\n\nIn response to a request from the Taliban, India pledged to provide \"further material support in the first instance to the health sector and for the rehabilitation of refugees\".\n\nThis offer comes amidst Pakistan's recent expulsion of over 500,000 Afghan refugees, adding to the challenges faced by Afghanistan.\n\nThe two sides also discussed enhancing bilateral ties and regional developments.

Some may find that icky, but for me, there's just something special about your child reaching teeth milestones. I'm not alone, because many cultures celebrate these enamel treasures in unique ways.\n\nIn Armenia, they hold a wonderful tooth ceremony called Agra Hadig, which means tooth kernel. As soon as the baby's first tooth pokes its head through a gummy smile, a party is organised where the mother places a thin veil over the baby's head and sprinkles wheat onto the child in the hope of bestowing a fruitful life.\n\nRead more: Ask the Dentist: What can our baby teeth tell us?\n\nThe veiled baby is sat in front of five symbolic items, each representing a different future profession. It's then over to the child to pick an item, which is an indication of the career path that the child will take in adulthood. I would have had only surgical instruments to choose from!\n\nIn Northern Europe, there was a tradition dating back to the 12th century of paying the Tand-Fé - a tooth fee given to each child who loses their first tooth. Teeth were considered so significant in Norse culture that warriors wore necklaces made from baby teeth and rode into battle, gladdened by the protection from this good luck adornment. One would hope that the little critters were paid in exchange for teeth that had already fallen out and were not subjected to the traditional Viking brutalities of the time.\n\nRead more: Ask the Dentist: Baby teeth need grown up care\n\nMoney is not in the equation when Mongolians are considering baby teeth. Around 40% of the population still lives a nomadic life, with dogs central to the family's protection and vibrancy. Mongolians take the approach of trading baby teeth for stronger ones. They achieve this by wrapping the baby tooth in a piece of fat and feeding it to their dog. The idea is that the child will develop teeth as strong as a dog's. And when there's no dog, the tooth is buried by a tree to transfer the strength of strong tree roots to the developing adult teeth.\n\nHere, the tooth fairy just has to deliberate over the current value of enamel and remember to do their job!","source":{"uri":"irishnews.com","dataType":"news","title":"The Irish News"},"authors":[],"image":"https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/FAPV2EANARK4PPAINLR3FTARUA.jpg?smart=true&auth=d89f5fd5374003cdc0b49750fd6ae8d6f332923d9cbd4d50c792906701afbfe5&width=1200&height=630","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.3019607843137255,"wgt":474099336,"relevance":18},{"uri":"b-2025-01-597371657","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"06:14:26","dateTime":"2025-01-09T06:14:26Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T06:14:13Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://singkeefoods.co.uk/gb/snacks/10543-magic-flakes-peanut-butter-cracker-28g-x-10.html","title":"Magic Flakes Peanut Butter Cracker 28g x 10","body":"Magic Flakes peanut butter cracker is a crispy and savoury cracker with a peanut butter filling.

Muttaqi told FS Misri that Afghanistan wants to be a key economic country in the region and strengthen economic ties.\n\nMuttaqi \"also assured the Indian side that there was no danger to anyone from Afghanistan\" and \"expressed his hope for enhancing diplomatic relations and facilitating visas for businessmen, patients, and students\".\n\nAccording to the Indian readout, the two sides discussed various issues relating to bilateral relations as well as regional developments.\n\nForeign Secretary Misri underlined India's historic friendship with the Afghan people and the strong people to people contacts between the two countries.\n\nIn this context, he conveyed India's readiness to respond to the urgent developmental needs of the Afghan people, the statement said.\n\nThe two sides evaluated the ongoing Indian humanitarian assistance programmes.\n\nThe Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister appreciated and thanked the Indian leadership for continuing to engage and support the people of Afghanistan.\n\nIn view of the current need for development activities, it was decided that India would consider engaging in development projects in the near future, in addition to the ongoing humanitarian assistance programme, the statement said.\n\nIn response to the request from the Afghan side, India will provide further material support to the health sector and for the rehabilitation of refugees.\n\nThe two sides also discussed strengthening of sports (cricket) cooperation, which is highly valued by the young generation of Afghanistan. It was also agreed to promote the use of Chabahar port for supporting trade and commercial activities, including for the purpose of humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.\n\nThe Afghan side underlined its sensitivities to India's security concerns. The two sides agreed to remain in touch and continue regular contacts at various levels.\n\nIt may be recalled that in response to the needs of the Afghan people, India decided to extend humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. India has so far dispatched several shipments consisting of 50,000 MTs of wheat, 300 tons of medicines, 27 tons of earthquake relief aid, 40,000 litres of pesticides, 100 million polio doses, 1.5 million doses of COVID Vaccine, 11,000 units of hygiene kits for the drug de-addiction programme, 500 units of winter clothing and 1.2 tons of stationery kits, etc, the statement added.\n\nThe meeting comes two days after India slammed Pakistan for its cross-border airstrikes in Afghanistan's Paktika province in which 46 civilians were killed.\n\nThe meeting also comes amid the just-concluded visit of the US NSA Jake Sullivan to Delhi, where he met PM Modi and NSA Ajit Doval. The Afghan Taliban today slammed the US for claiming to have provided millions of dollars in aid to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which it termed as incorrect.\n\nThe meeting between the two sides also comes amid sharply deteriorating ties between Islamabad and the Kabul regime.\n\nThe MEA spokesperson in a post on X said:\n\n\"Foreign Secy @VikramMisri met Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai today.\n\n\"Both sides discussed India's ongoing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, bilateral issues and security situation in the region.\n\n\"India reiterated its commitment to continue to provide humanitarian & development assistance to the Afghan people.

This is according to data from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, one of the leading environmental monitoring programmes in the world. The over warming resulted in numerous catastrophic events around the world, many of which caused death and destruction.\n\nAmong the worst episodes were the deaths of some 1,300 Muslims in June during the hajj to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit) at times during last year's pilgrimage and nearly 500,000 people were treated for heat stress, heat stroke and exhaustion. As at the end of August, there were a total of 44,000 heat-related deaths reported in Europe. India recorded some 40,000 heat stroke cases and over 700 deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated about 700 heat-related deaths in the US, but since there were over 2,300 in 2023, according to federal records, scientists believe that last year's figure will be much higher after there is full reporting. In Thailand there were over 60 deaths, while millions of children were affected.\n\nHuman beings were not the only fatalities. In August it was reported that globally millions of poultry and other livestock: pigs, calves, cows and sheep died while being transported from farms in trucks where the temperature measured upwards of 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit). In the US, as at the end of October last year, there were reports of over 100 deaths of pets - dogs and cats - from heat-related causes. During May, in Mexico, dozens of howler monkeys fell out of trees dead from extreme heat, while at least one zoo pumped air conditioning into the birds enclosure and fed its lions frozen meat lollipops to help them cope with the heat.\n\nAs early as January 2024, there had been predictions that some crops were going to be affected by the extreme heat expected during the year, as well as unprecedented wet weather that would come after the heat spells. The warning was that yields were going to contract and concomitantly, prices would increase. The crops listed as most likely to be affected were cotton, corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, cocoa, olives and potatoes. All of the data is not yet available, but food prices, even beyond the crops listed above, continued to skyrocket last year, following on from 2023 and the year before.\n\nThe parched earth was also host to a series of wildfires devastating several regions in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America, with the latter two continents being the worst affected. Between January and September, more than 400,000 fires were recorded across South America. In the Amazon, fires started earlier than usual owing to severe drought conditions from 2023. Brazil had the most wildfires (a 980% increase over 2023), followed by Venezuela, Bolivia, Guyana and Suriname. The Pantanal region, which lies mostly in Brazil but extends into Bolivia and Paraguay, the world's largest tropical wetland area, also saw unprecedented wildfire activity. Colombia was the only country in the region that saw below average fires last year. As a result, the European Commission's atmosphere monitoring service found an increase in carbon emissions from these areas that are prized for their forests and ecosystems that usually do the opposite - carbon capture.\n\nOver 38,000 wildfires had torn through the US up to the end of September last year, some 9,000 fewer than the year before. However, the 7.8 million acres burned was 2 million above the annual average lost to this phenomenon. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) reported in early September that 13.1 million acres had burned up to that time. This included July's destruction of a third of the town of Jasper in Alberta which saw US$646.73 million in insured damages. However the CIFFC noted that though very destructive 2024 had not topped 2023's burning season, the worst on record to date.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the same climate change that fuelled the heat ushered in relentless rainfall, storms and flooding also leaving death and destruction in their wake. In April, the United Arab Emirates received two years' worth of rain in a single day, turning parts of the desert-state into a lake. East, West and Central Africa saw around 2,000 deaths in historic flooding that also displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Water inundated Spain, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Slovakia in Europe; Brazil, Peru and Bolivia in South America; Afghanistan, China, Nepal, India, and Pakistan in Asia; Canada and the US in North America.\n\nThe global economic toll from these and other events related to climate change has been and will continue to be astronomical. A report that was presented at the opening of the 29th United Nations Climate Change Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan last November, estimated that over the last decade, climate related extreme weather events had cost the global economy more than US$2 trillion. This does not include the burgeoning rise in the cost of living.\n\nWith all of the above one might expect to see better human awareness and action to address this issue. That is unlikely. In fact, small gains that have been made can be expected to be lost after January 20. The outlook for 2025? As Arrow sang in 1982, \"Hot, Hot, Hot\".","source":{"uri":"stabroeknews.com","dataType":"news","title":"Stabroek News"},"authors":[],"image":"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2019/06/sn-article-default.png","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.1294117647058823,"wgt":474098995,"relevance":15},{"uri":"8492144517","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"06:07:08","dateTime":"2025-01-09T06:07:08Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T06:06:43Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.queenslandcountrylife.com.au/story/8862617/queensland-sorghum-farmers-brace-for-potential-rain-impact/?src=rss","title":"Soggy weather spells concern for Queensland sorghum growers with early crop","body":"Gregor Heard is ACM's national grains industry reporter, based in Horsham, Victoria.

It provides food security for\n\nmillions, serving as a staple food and livestock\n\nfeed. Its resilience to drought and heat stress\n\nmakes it an adaptable crop for challenging\n\nenvironments.\n\nSorghum cultivation in Somalia is a cornerstone\n\nof the country's agricultural sector, particularly\n\nin rainfed areas. Local varieties are well-\n\nadapted to the challenging climate and play a\n\ncrucial role in food security and livelihoods.\n\nFarmers rely on traditional knowledge and\n\npractices passed down through generations to\n\ncultivate sorghum, often integrating it with\n\nlivestock farming in agro-pastoralist systems.\n\n1.2 Objectives of the study\n\nGeneral objectives\n\n To assess the current status of insect pest\n\ninfestations in Sorghum plant.\n\n To develop and evaluate effective and\n\nsustainable insect pest managents\n\ninsecticide for Sorghum.\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\n To identify the major insect pests aaffecting\n\nSorghum plant.\n\n To determine the distribution and\n\nabundance of key insect pests throughout\n\nthe growing season.\n\n To assess the level of\n\ndamage caused by different\n\ninsect pests on Sorghum.\n\n1.3 Scope of the study\n\nThe importance of diagnosing\n\nand managing insect pests in\n\nSorghum crop. The goals of\n\nthe field report, including\n\nearly detection, accurate\n\ndiagnosis, and effective\n\nmanagement of insecticides.\n\nTechniques for identifying\n\ninsect pests based on visual\n\nsymptoms, damage patterns,\n\nand insect morphology. The\n\ndescription of common\n\nsymptoms caused by insect\n\npests, such as leaf damage,\n\nhead damage, and deadheart.\n\nThe use of insecticide, visual\n\ninspections, and sampling\n\ntechniques to monitor insect\n\npopulations in the field. This whole study was a\n\nmonth. I spent two weeks diagnosis, then two\n\nweeks controlling with pesticides. Finally, I\n\nspent another two weeks checking how well the\n\npesticide worked \"mode of action\", if it caused\n\nany effective, and how it affected the insects.\n\nThis study was conducted in the research and\n\npractice fields of Somali National University,\n\nfor faculty of agriculture and environmental\n\nscience, it was actually about a month, this\n\nstudy was semester assignment that submitted\n\nto Mr. Hussain Ahmed Nur one of the lectures\n\nof Somali National University at faculty of\n\nagriculture and environmental science.\n\n1.4 Questions of the study\n\n What are the most major insect pests\n\ncurrently infesting Sorghum plants?\n\n What is the most effective insecticide\n\nused to control insect pests of Sorghum?\n\n2.0 Literature review\n\n2.1 Sorghum plant:\n\nSorghum is a versatile and resilient\n\ncereal grain that is cultivated for food, fodder,\n\nand industrial purposes. It is a member of the\n\ngrass family and thrives in arid and semi-arid\n\nregions due to its drought tolerance. Sorghum\n\ngrains are used in a variety of food products,\n\nincluding porridge, bread, and beverages.\n\nAdditionally, sorghum stalks are used for\n\nanimal feed and biofuel production, making it a\n\nvaluable crop for both subsistence and\n\ncommercial agriculture.\n\nSorghum is widely distributed across\n\nthe globe, with significant cultivation in regions\n\nsuch as Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The\n\nUnited States, India, Nigeria, and Mexico are\n\namong the top producers of sorghum. In these\n\nregions, sorghum is grown primarily for grain\n\nproduction and animal feed. The crop's ability\n\nto withstand harsh environmental conditions\n\nmakes it an important staple in areas prone to\n\ndrought and food scarcity. Sorghum's\n\nadaptability has also led to its use in the production of gluten-free foods and alcoholic\n\nbeverages.\n\nAfrica is the largest producer of\n\nsorghum, with countries like Nigeria, Sudan,\n\nand Ethiopia leading in cultivation. Sorghum is\n\na crucial food crop in many African countries,\n\nproviding a primary source of calories for\n\nmillions of people. It is often grown in areas\n\nwhere other cereals, such as maize and wheat,\n\nstruggle to thrive. In addition to its use as a\n\nfood staple, sorghum is also used for brewing\n\ntraditional beers and spirits. The crop's\n\nresilience to drought and poor soil conditions\n\nmakes it a reliable choice for farmers across the\n\ncontinent.\n\nIn Somalia,\n\nsorghum is an essential\n\ncrop for both food security\n\nand economic livelihood. It\n\nis primarily grown in the\n\nsouthern regions of the country, where it serves\n\nas a staple food for the population. Sorghum is\n\nused to make traditional Somali dishes such as\n\n\"anjera\" (a type of flatbread) and porridge. The\n\ncrop's ability to grow in dry, arid conditions\n\nmakes it particularly suited to Somalia's\n\nclimate. Additionally, sorghum cultivation\n\nsupports the livelihoods of many smallholder\n\nfarmers,\n\ncontributing to the\n\ncountry's\n\nagricultural sector\n\nand food self-\n\nsufficiency.\n\n2.2 Shoot fly\n\nThe Sorghum shoot fly (Atherigona\n\nsoccata) is a small fly that resembles a\n\nhousefly. The adult female lays eggs on the\n\nunderside of sorghum leaves, and the larvae\n\nhatch and burrow into the growing shoot,\n\ncausing significant damage. The larvae feed on\n\nthe central growing point, leading to the death\n\nof the shoot and resulting in a condition known\n\nas \"deadheart\"\n\nInfestation typically occurs in young plants,\n\nmaking them stunted and unproductive. The\n\ndamage is most severe during the seedling\n\nstage, but can also affect older plants under\n\nhigh humidity conditions. The presence of\n\nshoot fly can lead to reduced yields and poor\n\ncrop quality, making it a significant pest for\n\nsorghum farmers.\n\nManagement strategies include cultural\n\npractices such as adjusting planting times, using\n\nresistant varieties, and applying appropriate\n\ninsecticides. Biological control methods, such\n\nas introducing natural predators, can also help\n\nreduce shoot fly populations. Integrated pest\n\nmanagement (IPM) approaches are\n\nrecommended to effectively control this pest\n\nwhile minimizing environmental impact.\n\nTaxonomic rank\n\n Domain: Eukaryota\n\n Kingdom: Animalia\n\n Phylum: Arthropoda\n\n Class: Insecta\n\n Order: Diptera\n\n Family: Muscidae\n\n Genus: Atherigona\n\nSpecies: Atherigona soccata\n\n2.3 Stem borer\n\nStem borers (Chilo partellus) are a major pest\n\nof sorghum, attacking the plant at various\n\nstages of growth. They lay eggs on the leaves,\n\nand the larvae hatch and bore into the stems,\n\nfeeding on the inner tissues. This can cause\n\nsignificant damage to the plant, including\n\nstunted growth, deadhearts, and lodging.\n\nThe life cycle of a stem borer typically involves\n\nfour stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The\n\neggs are laid on the leaves of the host plant, and\n\nthe larvae hatch and bore into the stems. The\n\nlarvae feed on the inner tissues of the stem,\n\ncausing damage to the plant. Once the larvae\n\nare fully grown, they pupate inside the stem.\n\nThe adult moths emerge from the pupae and lay\n\neggs, starting the cycle again.\n\nSeveral management strategies can be\n\nused to control stem borers in sorghum. These\n\ninclude cultural practices such as crop rotation,\n\nplanting resistant varieties, and timely planting.\n\nChemical control can also be used, but it is\n\nimportant to use insecticides carefully to avoid\n\nharming beneficial insects. Biological control\n\nmethods, such as the use of natural enemies of\n\nstem borers, can also be effective.\n\nTaxonomic rank\n\n Domain: Eukaryota\n\n Kingdom: Animalia\n\n Phylum: Arthropoda\n\n Class: Insecta\n\n Order: Lepidoptera\n\n Family: Crambidae\n\n Genus: Chilo\n\n Species: C. partellus\n\n3.0 Research methods\n\nI used note book as data collection method, in a\n\nfield of Sorghum there was huge number of\n\nplants I selected the damaged plants as sample,\n\nI noted all damage symptoms and names of\n\nlarvae and adult insect that was in a field.\n\nInstead of images of damages and insects I\n\ncaptured by using my cellphone as data\n\ncollection sample, and also I used the phone to identify the type of insect and damage caused\n\nby insects. Finally when I recognized,\n\ndiagnosed and identified the damage of insects\n\nand types of insects that caused these damage\n\nsymptoms. I decided and recommended using\n\nthree of two of insecticides and mixing together\n\nby ratio of 15:10, these insecticides was protect\n\nplus and power side.\n\n4.0 Discussion and results\n\n4.1 Results\n\nThis study has become evident that the\n\nuse of the two pesticides Protect plus and\n\nPower side are effective in controlling the two\n\npests that I have previously mentioned. This\n\ninvestigation and control took me 28 days to\n\ndetermine the results after spraying the\n\npesticide. It became clear to me that the use of\n\nthese pesticides is effective in controlling these\n\ntwo pests. I recommend that people farming in\n\nSorghum these pesticides if they find these\n\npests in their farms. I found that the two\n\npesticides that I used worked really well to get\n\nrid of the pests. It took me a month to see the\n\nresults, but the pesticides were very effective. I\n\nsuggest that farmers in Sorghum to use these\n\npesticides if they have the same pests like Shoot\n\nfly, and stem borer.\n\n4.2 Discussion\n\nData collection: notebook as data\n\ncollection method- notebooks are a reliable way\n\nto record observations in the field. They allow\n\nfor flexibility in recording different types of\n\ndata and can be easily reviewed later, Selection\n\nof damaged plants: focusing on damaged plants\n\nis a good way to identify the specific insects\n\ncausing the damage. However, it's also\n\nimportant to sample healthy plants to get a\n\nbaseline understanding of what a healthy\n\nsorghum plant looks like, Recording symptoms\n\nand insects- noting both damage symptoms and\n\nthe insects found on the plants is crucial for\n\naccurate identification and diagnosis, using\n\nphone for images- photos can be a valuable\n\naddition to written observations.\n\nThey provide visual documentation of\n\nthe damage and insects, which can be helpful\n\nfor identification and future reference, Using\n\nphone for insect identification-\n\nthere are many\n\ninsect identification apps and online resources\n\navailable that can help you identify the insects\n\nyou found. This can be a valuable tool, but it's\n\nimportant to double-check identifications with a\n\nknowledgeable entomologist if possible,\n\nManagement strategies: mixing insecticides-\n\nmixing insecticides can be a risky strategy, as it\n\ncan increase the likelihood of environmental\n\ncontamination and pesticide resistance. It's\n\ngenerally recommended to use a single\n\ninsecticide at a time, following the label\n\ninstructions carefully, Ratio of insecticides- the\n\nratio (15:10 ml). It's important to carefully read\n\nthe label instructions for both insecticides to\n\nensure they are compatible and to determine the\n\ncorrect mixing ratio.\n\n5.0 Conclusion\n\nhis study highlights the importance of\n\ndiagnosing and managing insect pests in\n\nsorghum crops. The goals included early\n\ndetection, accurate diagnosis, and effective\n\ninsecticide management. The research involved\n\nidentifying pests through visual symptoms,\n\ndamage patterns, and insect morphology.\n\nCommon pest symptoms included leaf damage,\n\nhead damage, and \"deadheart.\" Monitoring\n\ntechniques included visual inspections and\n\nsampling to assess pest populations.\n\nThe study spanned a month, divided\n\ninto three phases: two weeks of diagnosing\n\npests, two weeks of pesticide application, and\n\ntwo weeks evaluating pesticide effectiveness.\n\nTwo pesticides, Protect Plus and Power Side,\n\nwere tested against shoot fly and stem borer\n\npests. Results showed these pesticides were\n\nhighly effective, with noticeable pest control\n\nachieved within 28 days after application.\n\nThe study recommends farmers use\n\nthese pesticides for effective management of\n\nsimilar pests in sorghum fields. The findings\n\nemphasize the importance of a structured\n\napproach to pest management, combining early\n\ndetection, precise diagnosis, and strategic\n\npesticide use.\n\n6.0 Recommendations\n\n Conduct regular field inspections to\n\nidentify insect presence early.\n\n Use sampling techniques like sweep\n\nnets, sticky traps, and direct visual\n\nobservation.\n\n Promote research on alternative pest\n\ncontrol methods, including organic\n\noptions.\n\n Develop guidelines tailored to local pest\n\nchallenges and environmental\n\nconditions.\n\n Combine cultural practices (crop\n\nrotation, planting resistant varieties)\n\nwith biological controls.\n\n Use chemical insecticides only when\n\nnecessary to minimize resistance\n\nbuildup.\n\n Monitor pest populations post-\n\napplication to assess the mode of action\n\nand effectiveness of the insecticides.\n\n Record any unintended effects on non-\n\ntarget organisms or crop health.\n\n7.0 REFERENCES\n\n International Crops Research Institute\n\nfor the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT).\n\n(n.d.).

How can corn, soybeans and wheat affect Ohio's pastures?\n\nThe answer is through the Current Agriculture Use Value. In Ohio, CAUV is governed by the Department of Taxation in each county's auditor's office. In 1972, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to create CAUV. It was designed to help farmers by offering a value that would typically be below the true market value of the land, resulting in a lower tax bill. To qualify, a landowner must have 10 or more acres devoted exclusively to commercial agricultural use. If under 10 acres are devoted exclusively to commercial agricultural use, the farm must produce an average yearly gross income of at least $2,500.\n\nWhen determining the value of agricultural land, soil type is also taken into consideration with approximately 3,500 map units of soil that have a slope of 25% or less.\n\nAs it relates to pasture, the Ohio Department of Taxation reads, \"Where soil map units listed in these tables or comparable soils are used for permanent pasture, they should be valued as cropland.\" However, those pastures that do have a slope greater than 25% will report as the minimum which is $230 per acre (woodlands are also valued at the minimum).\n\nCAUV is based on five different factors, including cropping patterns. The tax commissioner calculates the total number of corn, soybeans and wheat acres that have been planted to get a percentage. They then take a five-year average from those crops to achieve the crop pattern for Ohio.\n\nCrop price comes from the past seven years of data with the highest and lowest prices eliminated. Then the remaining five-year prices are averaged. Crop yields are calculated by the 10-year average from the USDA regarding crop yields.\n\nNon-land production cost is data on crop productions used to estimate average non-land production costs. The data is taken from the Ohio Crop Production Budgets prepared by the Ohio State University College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.\n\nAnd finally, the capitalization rate is calculated by the past seven years of data with the highest and lowest interest rates eliminated. Then the remaining five-year prices are averaged. The interest rates come for Farm Credit Service.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are different values for over 3,500 different soil types. These values are called the productivity index or how likely the land is going to be able to produce crops. These values are determined by an ag advisory committee and sent to the Ohio Department of Taxation to finalize. Once finalized, it is sent to county auditors to record the calculations based on your property's soil type.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of these calculations once the productivity index number is established. Gross operating income (GOI) is found by taking the crop yield multiplied by average crop price (GOI = crop yield x average crop price). Net operating income (NOI) is found by GOI minus nonland production cost (NOI = GOI - non-land production costs). Finally, CAUV value is taking that NOI divided by the capitalization rate (CAUV value = NOI/capitalization rate).\n\nIf you were to look at the breakdown of the agricultural use of your property, it would show what soil type is in a parcel, how many acres of that soil type and what the agricultural value is of that property. You must file for CAUV every year before the first Monday in March at your local auditors' office.","source":{"uri":"farmanddairy.com","dataType":"news","title":"Farm and Dairy"},"authors":[],"image":"http://d27p2a3djqwgnt.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/02180601/short-2-copy.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.2862745098039217,"wgt":474098553,"relevance":60},{"uri":"8492132024","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"05:55:22","dateTime":"2025-01-09T05:55:22Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T05:54:54Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.5529412031173706,"url":"https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/world/133029/syrians_breathe_free_but_millions_remain_displaced","title":"Syrians breathe free but millions remain displaced","body":"There was a breath of fresh air in Syria as a newly liberated population ushered in the New Year with celebrations in downtown Damascus.\n\nThis was the first new year's celebration in 50 years without a member of the Assad family in power.\n\nBut as the country gradually comes to grips with a new post-Assad reality, the situation on the ground for many Syrians remains dreadful.\n\nSyrian investigative journalist Mohammed Bassiki, founder of Siraj, an investigative reporting organisation, tells MaltaToday the situation is \"catastrophic\", especially in the refugee camps.\n\n\"Millions of internally displaced Syrians remain in dire need of food and medical aid and many continue to live in refugee camps, particularly in northwestern Syria, which was a stronghold of armed opposition forces,\" Bassiki says.\n\nHe speaks to this newspaper at the turn of the year, just three weeks after the fall of the Assad regime at the hands of opposition forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.\n\nHe notes that the new transitional government has received support and messages of endorsement from various Arab countries, particularly the wealthy Gulf states. But of note is the pledge made by Ukraine, which is still trying to push back a three-year-old Russian invasion.\n\n\"Ukraine, a new ally of the government, has pledged 500 tonnes of wheat as humanitarian aid following the cessation of Russian supplies,\" Bassiki says, adding Ukraine announced the resumption of diplomatic ties with Syria.\n\nRussia was a key ally of Assad, propping up the regime with weapons and assistance. Russia also has two military bases in Syria, including a maritime base which gives it direct access to the Mediterranean.\n\nBassiki says the past few weeks have uncovered the magnitude of the atrocities perpetrated by the regime to suppress opposition and dissent.\n\n\"The collapse of the regime and Bashar al-Assad's escape revealed horrifying cases of detainees in former regime-controlled prisons, especially the infamous Sednaya Prison and other Syrian intelligence facilities,\" he says.\n\nOn the security front, he notes that the new Syrian government has begun restructuring internal security, appointing a new head of Syrian intelligence. Meanwhile, armed opposition forces are pursuing remnants of regime forces in remaining pockets along Syria's coastal areas, which had been a recruitment base for regime fighters throughout the Syrian revolution.\n\nThere have been multiple calls from various quarters within Syria for the new government to be inclusive. The country is a complex tapestry of different religions and ethnicities.\n\n\"Concerns about the potential exclusion of Syria's minority groups in the new regime have been continuously denied by the new administration's leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa,\" Bassiki says, noting that an inclusive Syrian government is a prerequisite for Western recognition and the eventual lifting of European and American sanctions.\n\nBut hope is being pinned on a what is being called a national dialogue conference that is expected to be held in the coming days. Bassiki says the conference will bring around 1,200 representatives from across Syria together to form a committee responsible for managing the next phase.\n\n\"This may include the potential dissolution of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the suspension of the former parliament (People's Assembly), and the suspension of the existing constitution,\" he says.\n\nAs Syrians navigate the new waters ahead, there is hope that after 13 years of civil war a different country can be born; a country that for the first time in half century is able to breathe free even if the air is heavy with suffering.","source":{"uri":"maltatoday.com.mt","dataType":"news","title":"MaltaToday.com.mt"},"authors":[],"image":"https://content.maltatoday.com.mt/ui_frontend/thumbnail/684/400/11_syrian_refugee_camp.jpg","eventUri":"eng-10229097","sentiment":0.02745098039215677,"wgt":474098122,"relevance":18},{"uri":"2025-01-597356762","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"05:51:37","dateTime":"2025-01-09T05:51:37Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T05:38:09Z","dataType":"news","sim":0.4627451002597809,"url":"https://www.freepressjournal.in/ampstories/photo-gallery/lohri-2025-5-must-have-traditional-foods-in-your-lohri-ki-thali","title":"Lohri 2025: 5 Must-Have Traditional Foods In Your Lohri Ki Thali","body":"The vibrant harvest festival of Punjab, Lohri, is just around the corner!

The meeting highlighted New Delhi's commitment to addressing Afghanistan's urgent development needs. Misri also received an assurance from Muttaqi that Afghan territory would not be used against India.\n\nThe meeting signals a major shift in India's approach towards Kabul since the Taliban took over in 2021. Earlier, Indian officials at the Joint Secretary level had met with Taliban ministers, including Amir Khan Muttaqi and Defence Minister Mohammad Yaqoob. However, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri's discussion represents a significant upgrade in engagement.\n\n\"In view of the current need for development activities, it was decided that India would consider engaging in development projects in the near future, in addition to the ongoing humanitarian assistance programme,\" read a statement issued by the MEA.\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced that both sides agreed to boost the use of Chabahar Port to support trade, commercial activities, and humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.\n\nThe meeting in Dubai occurred amid growing tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Afghanistan's ties with Islamabad have worsened due to Pakistan Taliban activities and retaliatory airstrikes on Afghan soil. India expressed solidarity with Afghanistan earlier this week, criticizing Pakistan for blaming its neighbors for internal issues. The meeting came two days after India condemned Pakistan's recent airstrikes, which killed 46 people, including women and children.\n\n\"We have noted the media reports on airstrikes on Afghan civilians, including women and children, in which several precious lives have been lost,\" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.\n\n\"We unequivocally condemn any attack on innocent civilians. It is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. We have also noted the response of an Afghan spokesperson in this regard,\" he added.\n\nOn December 24, Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan killed 46 people, drawing heavy criticism and a strong warning from Afghanistan's current government.\n\nThe strikes, carried out by Pakistani fighter jets, hit civilian areas in Barmal district, Paktika province. This marked the second such attack in 2024, following a similar strike in March that killed eight, including three children.\n\nAccording to a statement by Ministry of External Affairs, the Foreign Secretary emphasized India's long-standing friendship with the Afghan people and strong people-to-people ties. He highlighted India's commitment to addressing Afghanistan's urgent development needs.

Among the many varieties of the wheat flour (atta) available, Sharbati atta holds a special place. Known as the 'Gehoon ka Sartaj,' or the king of wheat, Sharbati atta is revered for its exceptional quality, flavour, texture, and distinct golden color making it the preferred choice for millions of households across India. But what is it about Sharbati atta that sets it apart from other varieties? Chef Ranveer Brar helps us delve into its rich history, uniqueness, and why it remains the go-to option for perfect rotis.\n\nSharbati wheat is grown in the fertile lands of Madhya Pradesh, where the nutrient-rich black cotton soil and well-distributed rainfall provide ideal conditions for cultivation. The region's distinct climate, with cool winters and ample sunshine during the grain-filling stage, further enhances the wheat quality, contributing to retaining essential nutrients, improved gluten strength, and a superior texture ideal for making light & fluffy rotis. Generations of farmers have refined traditional cultivation methods, blending them with modern practices to maintain the exceptional quality of Sharbati wheat. This combination of favourable soil, climate, and customary farming techniques makes Madhya Pradesh the perfect region for producing this premium wheat.

It said on a year-on-year basis, it was 7.13 percentage points higher than the rate recorded in September 2023 (30.64 per cent).\n\nWhile NBS reported in October that food inflation in Nigeria surged to 39.16 per cent year-on-year in October 2024, up from 31.52 per cent in October 2023.\n\nNBS report for November indicated that the food inflation rate stood at 39.93 per cent.\n\nWorried by the trend, President Bola Tinubu vowed that his administration will reduce the prices of food items and lower inflation to 15 percent from 34.60 percent as recorded in November 2024.\n\nThe President made this known in his 2025 New Year message to Nigerians last Wednesday.\n\nHe acknowledged persistent inflation and rising costs of essentials in the country.\n\nTinubu said his administration targets massive food production to lower the prices of food items nationwide and promote the local manufacturing of essential drugs and other medical supplies.\n\n\"In 2025, our government is committed to intensifying efforts to lower these costs by boosting food production and promoting local manufacturing of essential drugs and other medical supplies.\n\n\"We are resolute in our ambition to reduce inflation from its current high of 34.6 per cent to 15 per cent.\n\n\"With diligent work and God's help, we will achieve this goal and provide relief to all our people,\" Tinubu said.\n\nMeanwhile, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, CPPE, in its \"Nigeria 2024 Economic Review and 2025 Outlook Gross Domestic Product, GDP, Performance said that high inflationary pressure was a major concern in 2024 with November inflation peaking at 34.2%.\n\nCPPE noted that the situation had an impact on the economy, leading to general increase in the cost of living with consequential effects of aggravation of the poverty situation.\n\nIt also explained that the development elevated cost of operations and cost of production for businesses, and caused significant erosion of profit margins of many businesses.\n\nHowever, CPPE highlighted that inflation may moderate slightly on the expected reduction of the volatility of the exchange rate and possible rebound of the naira in 2025.\n\nThe organization predicts there would be moderation in energy cost as the geopolitical tension eases as result of the impact of Donald Trump presidency.\n\n\"There is also the factor of the base effect on the inflation numbers as inflation was generally elevated in 2024.\n\n\"However, the following key drivers of inflation may not completely dissipate in 2025: High energy cost including electricity tariff, exchange rate, transportation cost,\" it added.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to DAILY POST on the matter on Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer of SD & D Capital Management, Gbolade Idakolo, said the policy on 150-day zero tariff for selected food items failed due to bureaucracy.\n\nAccording to him, the government needs to walk the talk if it's serious about bringing down food inflation.\n\n\"The Federal government policy on 150-day zero tariff for selected food items failed due to bureaucracy surrounding the effective implementation of the policy.\n\n\"In a saner climate, people saddled with the responsibility of implementing the policy would have been held accountable to serve as a deterrent to others.\n\n\"I also critically oppose the time frame for implementation, which should have been at least two years to allow the policy to gain traction.\n\n\"The Federal government needs to walk the talk if we are serious about bringing down food inflation\", he told DAILY POST.\n\nOn his part, Dr Samson Simon, an Economist of the ARKK Economics and Data limited told DAILY POST that Nigeria is doing so badly as it's leading the world from behind on the food security index.\n\nThe economic expert attributed the recent stampede deaths in Ibadan, Anambra, and Abuja to the increasing food inflation in the country.\n\nSimon stated that agriculture has not been given the priority it deserves in Nigeria even when the country sits on bottom in terms of food availability.\n\nHe said: \"Apart from announcing the free food import as a temporary measure to bring down the price of food, in 2023, when this current government came on board, it declared an emergency on food insecurity.\n\n\"Virtually everything that they have done, nothing has moved a little; food inflation has been climbing unabated. Nigerians are going hungry, and that's why we saw the stampedes in Ibadan, Anambra, and Abuja, and these are relatively prosperous parts of Nigeria.\n\n\"So, you can imagine what's happening in other states when the prosperity might not be good as in Abuja or Ibadan or in Anambra.\n\n\"The truth is that our situation is beyond critical. Nigeria is doing badly; it's languishing at the bottom. When it comes to food security index, there are four criteria; two of them, Nigeria is doing so badly that it's leading the world from behind.\n\n\"One, availability of food, two, affordability of food: we are the worst place on earth in the affordability of food, and we are one of the worst places in the availability of food.\n\n\"Food challenge is not like it's a new thing, but just that it's getting worse.\n\n\"In the past, like the last government, they were encouraging all Nigerians to be farmers. There's no place on earth that I know that has defeated food insecurity by asking everyone to be a farmer; it's burying your head in the sand. What's lacking is that we have not mechanized, modernized agriculture in Nigeria.\n\n\"In this year's budget (2025), they didn't give agriculture the priority it deserves. In a country that is the worst place on earth in terms of food availability, they are assigning less than a trillion Naira to agriculture.\n\n\"I don't think that we are really serious about it. I don't blame the federal government alone, the states what have they done? Nothing. I think because it's a poor man's problem - the inability to afford food - maybe that is why it's not given the priority it deserves because the rich don't go hungry.\n\n\"They always have more than enough food to eat and only a small part of their income goes to feeding. So, it's not really a problem for them.\n\n\"The masses too don't really understand that they are the people with power. They get trapped by ethnicity, religiosity and other sorts of things to support people that are not performing.\n\n\"The poor masses in Nigeria don't really know their right and how to fight for it, and then the people in power are taking everyone for a ride.\n\n\"That's the sad thing because we have just been doing cosmetics, just pretending to be solving the problem but nothing really serious has been done.\"\n\nThe economic expert also lamented about insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to him, insecurity is also a major challenge as most farmers are now afraid of going to their farms because they could get killed.\n\nSuggesting what should be done to tackle the scourge, Simon said: \"My suggestion is that a quarter of the budget should go to agriculture to show how serious the problem of food is in Nigeria.\n\n\"Again, it's not just about assigning the quarter of the budget to agriculture, it's about being intentional because we have thrown money at the problem before and we have not seen results.\n\n\"So, it's not about throwing money but about being intentional about the result.\n\n\"If we push a quarter of our money in the budget to agriculture, we should see results. The last administration with the \"Anchor borrowers\" programme was just throwing money at the problem.\n\n\"We also need to mechanize and improve research in agriculture, and ensure appropriate financing.\n\n\"Insecurity is also a major challenge because people are afraid to go to their farm land as they could get killed, maimed or kidnapped. The government should ensure there's security.\"","source":{"uri":"dailypost.ng","dataType":"news","title":"Daily Post Nigeria"},"authors":[{"uri":"francis_ezediuno@dailypost.ng","name":"Francis Ezediuno","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/market.jpg","eventUri":"eng-10226907","sentiment":0.02745098039215677,"wgt":474096244,"relevance":58},{"uri":"2025-01-597336770","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"05:18:13","dateTime":"2025-01-09T05:18:13Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T04:29:27Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.newzimbabwe.com/go-beer-brewery-to-reopen-after-decade-closure/","title":"Go Beer Brewery to reopen after decade closure - NewZimbabwe.com","body":"GO Beer Brewery, a liquor manufacturing company located in Gweru, is set to reopen soon thereby creating 50 job opportunities.\n\nThe liquor undertaking concern run by City of Gweru was closed nearly a decade ago due to financial mismanagement that saw the company swimming in a staggering US$2.6 million debt.\n\nIn an interview, Gweru Mayor, Martin Chivoko said the reopening will boost Gweru's economy.\n\n\"With the resuscitation of Go Beer Brewery, we are excited to announce that the brewery will create employment opportunities for at least 50 people for a start.\n\n\"This is a significant boost to our local economy and will help stimulate economic growth,\" he said.\n\nThe premier also added that, \"We're thrilled to have partnered with Crest Street Industries to revive the brewery and restore it to its former glory.\"\n\nHe said the revival of Go Beer Brewery is crucial for the council's revenue generation which will also improve service delivery.\n\n\"We put 23 hectares under winter wheat at the Go Beer Farm, which we are going to use as raw materials for the brewery.

Why is this significant?","body":"India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri holds talks with Afghanistan's acting Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai. Image Courtesy: @MEAIndia/X\n\nOn Wednesday (January 8), India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri held talks with Afghanistan's acting Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai. These discussions are the first open talks that the two sides have held since the Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021.\n\nThe talks are also part of India's continuing engagement with Afghanistan in recent times. This is especially significant to note as New Delhi is yet to recognise the Taliban regime in the country.\n\nWhat was discussed in the meeting? Why do these talks matter to New Delhi? We unpack all this and more in our explainer.\n\nOn Wednesday (January 7), India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced that Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri held talks with Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, in Dubai.\n\nUntil now, an official from New Delhi at the Joint Secretary level has been meeting with Taliban ministers but Misri's meeting is an upgrade, signalling better engagement from New Delhi's side.\n\nThe meeting between Misri and Muttaqi wasn't just a meet-and-greet. The two held talks on various issues -- ranging from humanitarian assistance programmes to cricket.\n\nAccording to the MEA statement following the talks, New Delhi has agreed to provide material support to the health sector and for the rehabilitation of refugees. \"In response to the request from the Afghan side, India will provide further material support in the first instance to the health sector and for the rehabilitation of refugees,\" the MEA said.\n\nThis is in continuance to India's stance so far; New Delhi has already shipped 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat, 300 tonnes of medicines, 27 tonnes of earthquake relief aid, 40,000 litres of pesticides, 100 million polio doses, 1.5 million doses of COVID Vaccine, 11,000 units of hygiene kits for the drug de-addiction programme, 500 units of winter clothing and 1.2 tonnes of stationery kits to Kabul.\n\nMoreover, Misri, as per the MEA statement, also told the Afghan minister that New Delhi would consider engaging in development projects in the near future. This is of particular importance as India, which had a number of active development projects in the country, had stopped after the Taliban took over the Central Asian country.\n\nDuring Misri's talks with the Taliban minister, it was also agreed upon that trade and commerce would be promoted, including through the Chabahar Port. \"It was also agreed to promote the use of Chabahar port for supporting trade and commercial activities, including for the purpose of humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan,\" MEA said.\n\n\"The two sides also discussed strengthening sports (cricket) cooperation, which is highly valued by the young generation of Afghanistan,\" said the MEA in a statement.\n\nThe Taliban in a post-meeting statement also added that the two sides reviewed the security situation in the region. The Taliban stated that Muttaqi assured the Indian delegation that his government is pursuing a \"balanced and economy-oriented foreign policy.\" He expressed his desire for political and economic relations with India, recognising its significance as a prominent economic country in the region. \"Our foreign minister assured the Indian side that there is no danger to anyone from Afghanistan and expressed hope for strengthening diplomatic relations and creating facilities related to visas for businessmen, patients, and students,\" said the Taliban statement.\n\nThe Taliban also added that India had acknowledged its role in the fight against drugs and corruption in the country.\n\nIt's important to note that there was no mention of the issue of women's rights in the MEA or Taliban statement. Since their return to power, the Taliban has slowly but surely chipped away at women's rights in Afghanistan, making them almost invisible in the country.\n\nSince the Taliban resumed control of Afghanistan after ousting the Ashraf Ghani government, it has been seeking engagement with New Delhi. While India, initially, didn't engage with them, in the recent past it has edged closer. Recently, New Delhi reopened its diplomatic mission in Kabul, manned by lower-level diplomats.\n\nThe overtures began in 2022 when J P Singh, Joint Secretary (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran) in the Ministry of External Affairs, met key Taliban leaders. Since then, Singh and other officials have had at least four meetings, before the Foreign Secretary's meeting was arranged in Dubai.\n\nBut why is New Delhi engaging with the Taliban despite not recognising them officially? One of the main reasons is Pakistan.\n\nIndia's engagement with Afghanistan comes at a time when the Taliban's ties with Pakistan are strained. Kabul's ties with Islamabad have lately been strained over allegations that the Taliban harbour and support fugitive terrorists linked to the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, in carrying out \"terrorist\" attacks against Pakistani civilians and security forces.\n\nLast month, the Pakistani military allegedly carried out airstrikes against suspected TTP hideouts in an Afghan border province, drawing strong condemnation from the Taliban. Kabul claimed the bombardment took the lives of nearly 50 \"refugees\" from Pakistan. Noticeably, India condemned the strikes, saying it was Islamabad's \"old practice\" to blame its neighbours for its internal failure.\n\nThere's also the China factor. India is aware that Beijing is cosying up to the Taliban and that could endanger New Delhi's position in the Central Asian region. Since their coming to power, Beijing has been courting the Taliban with an eye on Afghanistan's resources.","source":{"uri":"firstpost.com","dataType":"news","title":"Firstpost"},"authors":[],"image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/01/taliban1-2025-01-bdff74081c78a0cde90b0b29c721e029.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","eventUri":"eng-10234566","sentiment":0.192156862745098,"wgt":474093223,"relevance":15},{"uri":"b-2025-01-597308017","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"04:25:18","dateTime":"2025-01-09T04:25:18Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T04:15:00Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://bowjamesbow.ca/2025/01/08/fiction-special-2.shtml","title":"(Fiction Special) The Dream King's Daughter Chapter Two: The Murder of Crows","body":"The public domain image above is Wheatfield with Crows, by Vincent Van Gogh and is courtesy Wikimedia.\n\nSo, when we last left Aurora, she was working as a waitress in Cooper's Corners, Saskachewan, with the uncanny ability to read the dreams of other people by looking them in the eye. When a dark force arrives and tries to grab her, she's pulled into a memory from three years before with her Mother in Winnipeg before they have to flee to Saskatchewan after being spotted by some disturbing crows. Aurora realizes that her life in Cooper's Corners has been a lie, as her mother has erased her memory...\n\n<<- Back to Chapter One.\n\nThe Dream King's Daughter - Chapter Two: The Murder of Crows\n\nAurora burst into the kitchen and set the coffee carafe aside with a sloshing clatter. \"What just happened out there?\"\n\nSilence descended in the kitchen, so far as it could. Polk and Matron stared at Aurora over the sounds of running water and sizzling bacon.\n\nPolk glanced from Aurora to Matron, then back. His mouth quirked up. \"Oh, wait, is this a game? Let me guess: you served coffee to a lot of customers? What do I win?\"\n\n\"Quiet, Polk,\" said Matron. To Aurora, she said, \"what are you talking about, dearie?\"\n\nAurora spluttered. They had to know! They'd run out of the kitchen to help her when--\n\nNo, wait, they hadn't. They're still here. They haven't moved from their posts.\n\nShe gripped a countertop, suddenly dizzy. \"This is... just... weird.\"\n\nPolk reached out, but stopped about a foot away. \"What is? What happened?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" Aurora gabbled, \"I fall on the floor, and suddenly I'm not on the floor. And the new customer who came in suddenly isn't--\"\n\n\"Whoa, whoa,\" said Polk. \"Wait: what new customer?\"\n\nAurora looked up at him, eyes wide and cheeks pale. The pieces of the picture came together. She'd waited on a new customer, and suddenly, he wasn't there. Nor was his truck. She remembered collapsing, and suddenly, she hadn't. She remembered Polk and Matron rushing to her rescue, and suddenly, they weren't.\n\nWhich meant the new customer and his truck and me collapsing didn't happen. I'm hallucinating. I'm sleeping walking. I'm crazy. Take your pick.\n\nAnd with Polk and Matron's eyes on her, full of concern, she knew this was not a decision she wanted to make in front of them.\n\n\"Um... yeah. Never mind.\" She picked up the carafe again. \"When's the next order up?\"\n\n#\n\nThe diner was deserted by 8 p.m., and Aurora, Polk and Matron took that time to clean up the place early. Aurora worked away, wiped down the tables, hauled the garbage out back, all on automatic. Her mind was full of dreams, and the childhood memories they had unlocked. Luckily, she could think and wield a dishcloth at the same time.\n\nThey were out the door only five minutes after closing time. Polk and Matron paid only passing attention to the red-gold sunset painting the landscape. They'd seen the scenery every day of their lives. The long shadows rippling over the wheat tops, like holes opening and closing in the golden field.\n\nAurora stood breathing the cooling air. Then she remembered the crows and scanned the tops of the tassels, listening for the beat of wings. Only the breeze whispered in her ears.\n\nShe pursed her lips. Were those part of the dream as well? When exactly had the dream started?\n\nA screen door creaked open, leading to the apartment over-top the diner the three shared. Polk poked his head out. \"Hey, Blond--\" He grinned at her look. \"You coming in or what?\"\n\nWell, why not ask him?\n\n\"Come here,\" she said, with a jerk of her head.\n\nHe crouched behind the protection of the screen door. \"I said I was sorry about the Blondie joke.\"\n\n\"No, you didn't,\" said Aurora. \"But I'm not going to hit you. I just want to ask you something.\"\n\nHe stepped out from behind the screen door and crept forward, arms raised. Aurora folded her arms impatiently, and he dropped his hands to his sides. \"What about?\"\n\n\"About the break we took this afternoon?\" She watched his expression. \"I threw that stone--\"\n\nHe chortled. \"Yeah, and you hit two crows? That was so cool!\"\n\nSo, that hadn't been part of the dream. Somehow, that's not comforting. \"What did I do, after?\"\n\n\"What, other than cheer?\"\n\n\"I didn't cheer!\"\n\nHe flashed her his lopsided grin. \"Why are you asking me, then?\"\n\nShe slugged him.\n\nHe staggered back, clutching his shoulder. \"You said you weren't going to hit me!\"\n\n\"Not about the Blondie joke. Be serious, for once! I know the question's silly, but I need an answer! What did I do next?\"\n\n\"You... Matron called us in. Said the Hobsons' order was up. You went into the diner.\"\n\n\"Did I say anything?\"\n\n\"Not a thing. I thought you were angry or something.\"\n\nShe looked away. \"I see.\"\n\n\"Were you?\"\n\n\"Was I what?\"\n\n\"Angry at me? You just clammed up and walked off without a word.\"\n\nShe gave him a tight smile. \"Nah -- I don't know, Polk, I'm just having a weird day.\"\n\nHe nodded slowly. \"Well, don't have too many of those, okay? I'm supposed to be the moody one, around here. I can't handle any competition.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Yeah, okay.\"\n\nHe nodded over his shoulder. \"C'mon! Matron's loading up the next season of Corner Gas.\"\n\nAurora followed Polk up the stairs to Matron's apartment. There, she and Polk sprawled next to Matron on the battered, fluffy couch and they watched their downloaded show on Matron's battered, wall-mounted widescreen. Popcorn rattled in the microwave. An hour later, Matron turned off the television and hauled herself off the couch, grimacing as her legs protested. \"Bedtime, Aurora. I'll straighten up.\"\n\nAurora nodded. No argument about staying up later, as Polk slept on the couch. She levered herself up and gave Matron a brief kiss on the cheek. \"G'night!\"\n\nPolk grabbed a set of blankets from behind the couch and flopped down, wrapping his cocoon around himself in record time. \"'Night,\" was his muffled response. Aurora and Matron went to their respective bedrooms. Aurora sat by her battered wooden desk, finishing off her algebra assignment for correspondence school.\n\nAt 11:00 p.m., she eased into bed, washed, brushed and wearing a long t-shirt. She pulled the covers to her chest and fluffed up the pillows behind her, and then lay back and stared at the ceiling.\n\nHow could I have forgotten my mother?\n\nTwo conflicting sets of memories bumped their shopping carts in the aisles of her mind. She remembered growing up with her mother, and she remembered having no parents at all. She remembered going to a real school in St. Boniface, picnics on the shores of Lake Winnipeg, and she remembered living in Cooper's Corners, in northern (actually, west-central; 'northern' had been her assessment as a resident of Winnipeg) Saskatchewan, all her life, coming to Aunt Matron as a young orphan, playing with the village kids, being homeschooled and gradually taking over the waitressing duty until she grew into her life of wiping counters and serving coffee all day, every day.\n\nAnd as she reached back in her mind, the memories of Manitoba flooded her. Summer barbecues. Homework. Roger, the school bully.\n\nShe shuddered. Okay, it was a mixed bag, but the tumble of revealed memories told her what was real and what was fake. She'd had a mother. She also had an aunt Matron, and three years of experience living in Cooper's Corners, waiting tables, babysitting Britney. But somehow she'd been made to think that there was no one else but Aunt Matron. And as she finally remembered the trip that had taken her from Winnipeg to this place, she had a pretty good idea of who had done this to her.\n\nConfusing the picture was the crow man, and the cloud of crows that had filled her vision when she had looked him in the eye. What was up with that? Had she dreamed it all while she was sleepwalking?\n\nPart of her mind spoke up. No, it said. Something attacked me. When that black truck arrived, something -- possibly the crow man -- pulled me into a dream and tried to grab me. And I reacted by ducking back into a deeper dream, about the day before I came here, breaking the hypnosis that kept me here.\n\nBut how could I do that without anybody noticing? I don't sleepwalk. I don't even sleep, remember?\n\nTomorrow, she thought, I'm going into that diner with my eyes open.\n\nAurora grabbed the first book off her bedside table, The Kite Runner, found her place, and began reading.\n\nShe finished the book by midnight, set it down, and picked up the next book on her pile, A Thousand Splendid Suns. She adjusted her pillows around her and started in\n\nAt 1:00 p.m., she left her bedroom to go pee. Returning to her room, she took up Terry Pratchett's Small Gods and started to read. At 2:30 p.m., she set that book aside and turned out the light. She lay in bed and stared at the ceiling.\n\nAt 3:00 a.m., she caught the time off the low-light display of her tablet and stared up at the ceiling again.\n\nHer teachers were convinced that she was a fast reader; instead, she simply had more time to read. But in the end, there was only so much you could read at one time. If you didn't want to wake up the house around you, you ended up staring up at the ceiling, waiting for the sun to rise. And that's when the darkest thoughts started to materialize if you weren't careful.\n\n\"Maybe I'm dead,\" she muttered aloud. And why not? Now that she remembered, it was practically a medical diagnosis...\n\n#\n\n\"So, Aurora,\" said Dr. Zane. \"You're in perfect health. Is there anything else?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Aurora couldn't suppress the urge to look around to make sure they were alone, even though the doctor's office was half the size of her bedroom. She leaned close. \"I can't sleep.\"\n\nThe doctor frowned. \"You're having trouble sleeping?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"How long has this been going on?\"\n\nShe looked into his eyes.\n\n\"And the Nobel prize in medicine,\" the M.C. shouts, \"for his contributions to medical science: Dr. Myron Zane!\"\n\nDr. Zane approaches the podium, carried on the shoulders of his colleagues. The audience chants \"Zane! Zane! Zane!\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" he shouts to the cheering masses. \"I owe it all to--\"\n\nInstead of \"the past four months\", Aurora said, \"A while.\"\n\n\"Everything good at school?\"\n\nShe stopped herself from rolling her eyes. He'd ask that about a hangnail. \"Fine.\"\n\nHe blinked. \"Everything good at home?\"\n\n\"It's fine!\"\n\n\"Your bed uncomfortable?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Something worrying you?\"\n\nOther than the fact that I don't sleep and that I look into people's dreams whenever I look them in the eye? \"No.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair. \"Many people have trouble getting to sleep, Aurora. You're probably putting too much pressure on yourself. It's a bit of a catch-22. I can get you information on some relaxation exercises you can try as you go to bed...\"\n\nHe droned on. Aurora stared at his steepled fingers. This is going nowhere. But how can it go anywhere when I haven't told him the true extent of the problem?\n\nIt had started slowly. In the days after that first alarming bleed and those deeply embarrassing conversations about maxi-pads and tampons, Aurora tossed and turned at night.\n\nShe didn't think there was anything unusual about that. In the stress of those days, of course she'd have trouble getting to sleep. And she wasn't tired when she woke up in the morning. At school, when her teacher droned on and some of the students nodded off, she just got restless instead. So, it didn't alarm her much to see her bedside clock display 1:00, 3:00, 5:00 and 7:00 each night.\n\nUntil the night when she didn't sleep at all.\n\nAnd the night after that.\n\nOkay, maybe hel'll jump at a chance to make a medical case history out of me. If he figures out what's wrong with me, then he deserves a Nobel Prize. This isn't normal.\n\n\"Look, I can't sleep,\" she cut in. \"I don't sleep. I stay up all night staring at the ceiling. I haven't slept for, like...\" She caught herself again, then forced the words from her mouth. \"Four months. Straight.\"\n\nDr. Zane had leaned forward as she said this, his brow furrowing, but now he sat back, his face clearing like the end of a storm. \"Oh, you're worrying too much!\"\n\nHer voice rose. \"I already said I'm not! There's something wrong with me. Test me!\"\n\n\"Aurora, I don't need to examine you to know that you're sleeping,\" said Dr. Zane. \"If you went more than ten days without sleep, you'd be dead. You're sleeping. You just don't remember sleeping. Now, about those relaxation exercises...\"\n\nShe slumped back in her seat. Maybe I dream about the clock showing me 3:00 a.m. Maybe I dream of listening to the BBC World Service because I've heard all the other podcasts several times. Or maybe I'm dead and haven't realized it yet.\n\nFunny, though. I would have thought the dead got lots of sleep.\n\n#\n\nAurora blinked back the memory and closed her eyes.\n\nYou've done this before. Just close your eyes and take deep, slow breaths. Cleansing air in. Stressed air out. Let the day's jumbled thoughts slip beneath the waters of silence, if not sleep.\n\nThe clock display flipped to 3:20 a.m.\n\nAfter two hours of deep breathing and thoughtful silence, courtesy Dr. Zane, Aurora looked over at her clock radio and saw the display flip to 5:25. Outside her window, she saw the first glimmer of dawn. The drapes twisted in a cool breeze and brought the smell of rain. Somewhere, with the sound of distant rolling kegs, thunder rumbled.\n\nAurora rolled out of her bed and padded to the bathroom. In front of the mirror, she dragged a comb through her bed-matted hair and stared at her reflection. Other than some troublesome pimples, and that little snub nose she hated, the face staring back at her was that of a typical, mildly pretty teenage girl. She didn't even have rings under her eyes.\n\n\"Not bad for a dead girl,\" she muttered.\n\nI'm not dead, am I? I'm just weird. A great medical mystery. I'd spend the rest of my life in sleep laboratories if I could get any doctor to believe, for one second, that I've been wide awake, now, for three years and count--\n\nAurora froze with her hand halfway to the knob of her bedroom door.\n\nI did sleep. In the car, when Mom played that tape on me. It was the first time I can recall sleeping since I got my period.\n\nHer hand fell to her side.\n\n\"Mom, what did you do to me?\"\n\nAnd why?\n\n#\n\nIn the diner, Aurora got the coffee ready and laid out the cutlery. In the kitchen, Matron turned on the toasting machine -- a ludicrous device that could toast bread for a restaurant four times the diner's size and eight times the diner's clientele -- and the diner filled with the smell of roasting crumbs. Matron turned on the grill and scraped it down.\n\nAurora watched as the dawn fought to brighten against a line of dark clouds along the horizon. As she worked, she caught flashes of lightning out of the corner of her eye. Moments later, the sound of distant thunder rolled across the fields.\n\nA thunderstorm. Was that good for the crops this time of year? Her country-girl self wouldn't have needed to ask, but her real self hadn't a clue.\n\nGravel crunched outside as the first pick-up pulled up. The door jangled. Ike Henderson slid into the booth seat. \"Hey, Aurora.\"\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Henderson,\" said Aurora. \"You by yourself?\"\n\nIke nodded. \"Molly and Britney will be along for dinner, but I got work to do.\"\n\n\"Farm work?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" He grinned at her.\n\nAurora winced. It had sounded lame, but she couldn't think of anything else to say. The memories of her city girl upbringing had robbed her of country small talk. She poured him a cup of coffee and set the mug in front of him. As he nodded his thanks, their eyes met.\n\nIke drives his tractor, turning the black soil over. The field behind the plow turns to straight, long furrows. The ground sprouts green, then yellow, as the stalks rise up. He glances behind him, and smiles.\n\nOn the horizon, a thunderstorm rumbles. Somewhere, a crow caws.\n\nAs she snapped out of the dream, the crow's caw echoing in her ears, Mr. Henderson turned to look at the cloudy horizon beyond the window. \"Odd storm, coming in from the east like that,\" he said. \"It's like it's rolling in backwards.\"\n\nShe frowned at him. \"What do you mean?\" But there was another crunch of gravel outside and a car door slammed.\n\nThe storm brewed as the day drew on, and people came and left. The clouds turned into mountain peaks under the noonday sun. Aurora couldn't stop herself from taking quick glances at it as she polished the table tops or served up the meals through lunch.\n\nAfter two there were no more tables to polish, no more cutlery to rearrange. The diner was empty. Polk and Matron came out of the kitchen. Polk grabbed some ketchup bottles to be refilled while Matron flipped between the TV channels, looking for news.\n\nAurora flipped the towel over her shoulder and sat down at the counter near them. \"Slow day,\" she said.\n\nPolk shrugged. \"It happens. Sometimes people decide to make their own lunches. Shocking, I know. It should be banned--\"\n\nFrom her stool, Aurora kicked him in the shin.\n\n\"Ow!\" He whined theatrically. \"Matron!\"\n\n\"Now, now,\" said Matron, giving up and leaving the TV muted on some trashy reality show. \"None of that.\" She plopped down a deck of cards.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Aurora. \"I've got a book to read.\" She turned towards the diner's exit.\n\nThe door jangled as she stepped outside. The gravel crunched underfoot.\n\nOutside, halfway to the door to the apartment, Aurora stopped. She did a slow turn, scanning the whole flat landscape and listening hard to the sounds around her. The sun baked the back of her neck.\n\nNo cars passed on the roadway outside the diner. No kids shouted on the rusting playground swings on the corner. Starlings chirped from the tassels, but Cooper's Corners' houses stood silent.\n\nWhat am I doing here? We're out in the middle of nowhere. Mom had objected to that, when she'd called Matron, and I can see why. You'd think that if you were going to hide someone, it would be among other people. But here, in this driveway, with only the sounds of nature for company, I could imagine that all of the people had gone, and that me, Polk and Matron were the only humans left alive -- alive and alone, facing... what?\n\nFrom the eastern horizon came the sound of distant thunder. Aurora shivered in the midsummer heat.\n\nShe went into the back apartment and grabbed her book from the bedside table. Then, as she left her bedroom, she paused beside Matron's bedroom door. She'd promised herself that she'd get Matron's secret out of her, but now that she stood on the threshold of violating the woman's privacy, Aurora hesitated.\n\nThis is the woman who has cared for me all my life -- okay, the past three years. She wasn't one to show much affection, but she wasn't all bristles and snide, either. She'd encouraged me to go to the country social when I was sure it would do nothing but leave me holding up a wall. But I'd had fun, with Polk. No, Matron wasn't Mom, but she'd been... okay.\n\nAnd I intend to repay this by snooping around her bedroom?\n\nBut then again, people had gone snooping through my memories, hadn't they? And Matron had to be in on that.\n\nAurora twisted the doorknob with more vigour than she'd intended. The door swung open and she had to catch it before it banged against the wall.\n\nThe bedroom was as neat as the rest of Matron's house and restaurant. White curtains were drawn against the window. The bed was made with white sheets and hospital corners. The closet door was closed, and the dresser was bare, save for a handheld mirror. A single shelf held a dozen cookbooks. Beneath it on the floor was a wooden chest.\n\nIt was neat. Sensible. Just like Matron. But Aurora frowned. It was more than sensible: it was without personality. This was a room withholding comment its occupant.\n\nExcept for the wooden chest. It looked like a toy chest that might hold dress-up clothes. Aurora came forward for a closer look. It was unlocked. She opened the lid and peered in.\n\nThe box was full of old, childish junk. Aurora pulled out a raggedy doll, a bundle of ancient lolly-pops, a couple of building blocks, and a large book. What were these, keepsakes? It's like an emergency kit for someone who'd rescued children.\n\nThe book had no title. It was thick, and had a picture of mountains on the cover. She opened it.\n\n\"Sally flies over mountains. She reaches down and touches a peak. The snow crumbles on her fingertips...\"\n\nAurora flipped through the pages, caught images dark and light, but nothing that interested her. She put the book back in the chest and closed the lid, disappointed. It had been a fruitless search, and now Matron and Polk were going to be wondering where she was. She hurried downstairs.\n\nBack in the diner, she sat at the counter, seats away from Matron and Polk. She kept her nose in her book, turning pages only when she remembered to, and thought of her next move.\n\nOn the horizon, a sun-bleached farmhouse disappeared behind a veil of rain.\n\nAt four, Matron stood up from the card game. \"Let's get ready for dinner hour.\"\n\nBefore long, the gravel outside scrunched and the shop bell jangled as the usual crowd trickled in. Britney bolted through the door, followed by her mother. She ran up to Aurora, flung her arms around Aurora's legs and gave her a big hug before rushing to her seat. Aurora watched her go with a raised eyebrow, but she smiled.\n\nThe Hobsons arrived a few minutes later, followed by the Pankiws, then the farmhands from the fields. Soon the place was chattering, and Aurora was working the tables. Hamburgers and fries. A Hungry Man (four eggs, four bacon, four sausages, ham and a coronary). Some of Matron's pot pie. Aurora carried the plates to their tables as the orders arrived.\n\nWhen there was nothing left for Aurora to do but refill the coffee, she jabbed the buttons on the remote. The regulars liked to ignore the six o'clock news while they ate their meals, but she couldn't find a signal. She gave up when she spied Britney finishing the last of her burger and pushing the tomato to the side of her plate with the end of her knife, eyes narrowing in disdain. Aurora then began tallying orders on the cash register and delivering them one by one to the tables.\n\n\"So, how was everything?\" Aurora asked the Hobsons as she scribbled on her notepad. She ripped off the slip and held it out. Then she stared a long moment, wondering why she was holding a bill out to an empty booth.\n\nShe looked to her left, then her right. The Hobsons should have been in front of her, but they weren't, and they weren't at any of the other tables either.\n\nAurora crumpled the bill and darted for the kitchen. Matron looked up as she burst in.\n\n\"The Hobsons!\" said Aurora. \"They skipped out without paying!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Matron.\n\n\"What do you mean, what am I talking about?\" Aurora waved her arms. \"Hobson family. They had one roast beef and one eggs benedict plus a whole lot of coffee and two slices of pie. $29.95, not including taxes and tip! I wrote up their bill, but they left before I could hand it to them!\" Then she realized that Matron was frowning at her, rather than at the news. \"What?\"\n\n\"I never made up an order for eggs benedict,\" said Matron.\n\nAurora gawped at her. \"But... I took their order!\"\n\nMatron shrugged and turned back to the grill. \"Well, if you did, you didn't hand it to me. Maybe that's why they left without paying.\"\n\n\"But I served them! You cooked it up!\" Aurora stared at Matron. \"You've got to remember!\"\n\nMatron clucked her tongue. \"You're imagining things, girl. I know what I served up to my customers today, and eggs Benedict wasn't on that list. Maybe you were remembering yesterday? Maybe one of yesterday's bills got mixed up in your hands?\"\n\nAurora bit her lip. Then she took a deep breath. \"Yeah,\" she said. \"Must be.\"\n\nShe turned on her heel and strode out of the kitchen.\n\nOutside, distant thunder rolled over the sounds of dinner. Aurora looked up and down the diner. Save for the Hobsons, everybody else was here. Ike Henderson got up from the table, stretched, and ambled to the washroom.\n\n\"Hey, Aurora!\" shouted Jake, a gawky farmhand sitting with his friends in a booth.\n\nWithout thinking, Aurora looked at him. Their eyes met.\n\nThe bikini is very, very small, and Aurora is very, very... bouncy, as she races down the sand, giggling and...\n\nAurora gave him a look that could melt cast iron. \"What?\" she bellowed, making the diners around her jump.\n\nThe farmhand went pale. His friends at his table started to snicker. He gulped and held up an empty glass. \"Um... more water... please?\"\n\nThe sky darkens. There is a flash of lightning.\n\nAurora looked away, ashamed of herself. It's not like he could control his dreams, or know that she wanted him to. She didn't need to strike him down with lightning, tempting though that was. \"Sure,\" she muttered, and went behind the counter.\n\nAs she pulled a glass from the rack and filled it from the tap, she frowned. The thunder and lightning hadn't been hers. It was a part of Jake's dream. Thunder and lightning on the beach? Why would the storm invade his dream like that?\n\nAnd why does 'invade' sound so right?\n\nShe jumped as the water overflowed the glass and ran over her hand. She shut off the tap, poured a little out, then marched over to Jake's table and plunked the glass in front of him. \"Thanks,\" he said. Then she looked up.\n\nThe booth was empty.\n\nAurora stepped back, tripped on her feet and fell, catching herself on the stools by the counter.\n\nThe diner silenced. She felt nearly a dozen pairs of eyes stare at her, and her cheeks reddened. She pushed herself back to her feet. \"It's okay,\" she said. \"I'm okay.\"\n\nBut it wasn't okay. The ripple of conversation was quieter than it had been a couple of minutes ago. She was seeing more empty vinyl where there should have been people. There'd been no sound of the bell on the doorjamb jingling, she was sure of it. No one had left the restaurant in the last ten minutes, and yet the noise level had gone steadily down.\n\nAt the far end of the diner, Aurora saw Mr. Radwanski pull his wallet from his pocket. She grabbed up his bill. Keeping him in sight as she walked up to him, she looked down at the last moment to total his bill. She tore off the slip. \"So, was everything okay?\"\n\nShe stared at an empty booth.\n\n\"Aurora? Are you okay?\"\n\nThe diners were staring at her again. The remains of them, anyway. And in the kitchen, Matron's grill sizzled like nothing was wrong. Thunder rumbled.\n\nShe tried to slow her thumping heart. Failed. This was getting worse.\n\nThen her eyes shot back to Mrs. Henderson and Britney. What was wrong with this picture? Then she remembered. Mr. Henderson still hadn't come back from the bathroom.\n\nIgnoring the looks of the remaining customers, Aurora barged into the men's room. At the urinal, Polk yelped and zipped himself up. \"Hey!\"\n\nThere was only one sink, one urinal and one stall with a toilet. Aurora crouched and peered beneath the barrier. There were no feet in front of the toilet. \"Where's Mr. Henderson?\"\n\nPolk cast the damp towels into the waste bin. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nShe straightened up. \"Ike Henderson! You know who he is, don't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I do!\" He frowned at her. \"Aurora, what's going on?\"\n\n\"Did he come in here?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What?\" Aurora scanned the walls for hidden doorways, hatches. \"He came in here! I saw him go in here! Didn't you see him?\" She turned this way and that in the middle of the small room. \"Mr. Henderson! Where are you?\"\n\nPolk caught her by the shoulders and held on as she struggled. \"Calm down!\"\n\nShe slapped his hands away. \"Don't you tell me to calm down! Either Ike Henderson was here and he disappeared, or I'm losing my mind! So, which is it, huh?\"\n\n\"Um...\" He swallowed. \"Which do you want it to be?\"\n\nShe turned away with an exasperated yowl and burst out of the washroom...\n\n...into an empty diner.\n\nThe grill was silent. Behind her, the door to the empty men's room swung on its hinges.\n\nThe jangling of the bell caught her attention and Aurora looked at the door. Mrs. Henderson held it open for her daughter. They were leaving. Alone. The last customers of the night. The door swung shut behind them.\n\nAurora charged the length of the diner. \"Mrs. Henderson! Wait!\"\n\nShe ran out the door and looked around wildly. In the dying light of the sun, she saw a young girl standing with her doll in the middle of the road.\n\n\"Britney!\" Aurora cried. The girl turned, her doll hanging by her side. Aurora ran onto the road and pulled Britney to the shoulder.\n\nAurora knelt in front of Britney and looked her in the eye.\n\nBritney swings in Aurora's arms, twirling around the wheat stalks, laughing. Mr. Scaly is safely locked inside his pet carrier. The sun shines and the birds sing.\n\nThe sky darkens.\n\nOver Aurora's shoulder, clouds appear, solidifying into a thousand black shapes, flapping closer.\n\nAurora blinked. Britney stared back, lost but strangely calm.\n\n\"He's coming for you,\" said the girl.\n\n\"What?!\" Aurora shook the strange vision out of her head. \"What were you doing out here?\" She tried to keep the edge out of her voice. \"You can't just stand in the middle of the road like that. What would your parents think?\"\n\nBritney blinked. \"Not here,\" she said distantly. \"Mom. Dad. Not here.\"\n\nAurora swallowed. This is getting worse. Scratch that. It had passed worse and was well on its way to catastrophic. \"Come inside, Britney. C'mon, let's get some ice cream.\"\n\nBritney looked up at her with wide eyes. \"Chock-lit?\"\n\nAurora smiled. \"Of course.\"\n\nShe turned towards the diner and felt Britney's hand slip from her fingers. Aurora turned. She was alone on the gravel driveway. Around her, the wind sighed in the grain.\n\n\"Britney?\" she shouted. \"Britney!\"\n\nBritney's doll lay sprawled on the gravel. Aurora picked it up and clasped it to her shoulder. Thunder rumbled.\n\nAurora turned. The clouds were almost upon her.\n\nShe drew breath for a scream, but the words caught in her throat as a crow cawed. Aurora's gaze shot round and then she saw it, perched atop the power pole where the gravel drive met the wheat field. One crow for sorrow, she thought.\n\n\"Aaa! Aaa!\" said the crow, a sound like a rusty gate. Then, \"Aaa! Roa! Raa!\"\n\nAurora blinked.\n\nThe crow stretched its wings and kicked off its perch, coasting down into the wheat field and perching on a seeder. It tucked its wings in and looked back at her, focusing on her with one eye, then the other. It cawed again: \"Aaa! Roa! Raa!\"\n\nAurora shouted. \"Who are you? What do you want? What did you do to all the people?\"\n\n\"Aaa! Roa! Raa!\"\n\n\"I know who I am! Tell me something I don't know!\"\n\n\"He! ... He!\" the crow cawed. Then, \"He! ... Comes!\"\n\nMovement caught her eye, and she looked up at the billowing clouds. Crows were flying in from every direction, hovering in the air in front of her, forming like a cloud of starlings, then like smoke. As Aurora watched, the cloud pulled itself into shape. She could make out the beginnings of a head, two arms, hands outstretched in a gesture like longing--\n\n\"Aurora! Wake up!\" Matron shouted.\n\nAurora whirled around and stared down the barrel of a browning rifle. She hit the muddy dirt as Matron fired over her head. The crows scattered, crying murder--\n\n--and Aurora snapped awake, gasping and dripping.\n\nMatron pulled her up with one hand, the other holding her rifle.\n\n\"Oh, thank God,\" gasped Aurora. \"It was only a dream.\"\n\n\"Yup,\" said Matron, looking pale. \"You're awake. And now you need to run.\"\n\n\"What?\" She blinked. \"Since when do you own a rifle?\" Wait a minute, what was the rifle still doing here? Wasn't it part of the dream?\n\n\"Look around you, girl!\"\n\nAurora turned and immediately wished she hadn't. The billowing, twisting grey clouds were still there. They had turned black and feathery, and they were descending. Shingles were blowing off the houses in Cooper's Corners. Somewhere, a window smashed.\n\n\"Where is everybody?\" Aurora yelled.\n\n\"They're sheltering,\" Matron shouted. \"Waiting for the storm to pass, but it won't. Not while you're here.\" She drew back the pump of the rifle, a classic click-click. Then she came closer and looked Aurora in the eye. \"You know, don't you? Don't try to deny it, girl, I can see it in your eyes. After all the trouble your mom went through to put you to sleep, you woke up. I thought you might. You were always a stubborn child.\"\n\nSo many things that she wanted to say crowded into Aurora's mouth that she spluttered.\n\nMatron hefted the weapon onto her shoulder. \"Well, maybe it's for the best. He's coming for you. It's best you be wide awake when you run.\"\n\n\"Run?! Run from who? Who's coming for me?\"\n\n\"No time!\"\n\n\"But where will I go?\"\n\n\"Go to Saskatoon.\" Matron shoved a piece of paper at her, along with a set of car keys. \"I've written down the address. I can't keep you safe anymore, so you need to get back to her.\"\n\n\"Back to who? What are you talking about?\" Aurora wanted to scream and cry and shake Matron to make her explain.\n\n\"No more questions!\" Matron yelled over the rising rumble of the wind and the cry of crows. \"Just go! Go now! You can't let him take you, girl! It will be disaster if he does!\"\n\nAurora looked up at the spiralling clouds again. She froze.\n\n\"Run, you idiot!\" Matron yelled. \"Run!\"\n\nAurora ran, mud squelching and gravel crunching. Matron's battered brown Chevy came into view. Slipping and skidding, she caught herself with one hand on the car roof and fumbled with the door handle. It was unlocked and opened suddenly, knocking her hand, sending the keys to the gravel. Aurora twisted to pick them up, and fell over into a puddle.\n\nThe light went out of the sky.\n\nAurora grabbed the keys, dove into the car and slammed the door. The car shook in the buffeting winds. Without thinking, she pulled on her seat belt and checked the rear-view mirror. She cried out.\n\nThe crows descended on Matron like a funnel cloud. Matron brought up her rifle and sighted along the barrel.\n\nAurora turned the key in the ignition. The station wagon sputtered to life and she danced on the clutch. Gears creaked as she shoved it into first. Wheels spinning, gravel spraying, she manhandled the car onto the road. Second gear and the car picked up speed. Third gear. Go.\n\nBehind her, she heard the rifle blast, and the murder of crows.","source":{"uri":"bowjamesbow.ca","dataType":"blog","title":"By James Bow"},"authors":[],"image":"https://bowjamesbow.ca/assets_c/2025/01/Vincent_Van_Gogh_-_Wheatfield_with_Crows-thumb-320x320-36399.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":-0.06666666666666665,"wgt":474092718,"relevance":100},{"uri":"8492043872","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"04:22:33","dateTime":"2025-01-09T04:22:33Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T04:21:45Z","dataType":"news","sim":0,"url":"https://www.newsweek.com/wegmans-sorbet-recall-over-undeclared-egg-allergen-2012104","title":"Wegmans sorbet recall over undeclared egg allergen","body":"Northeastern supermarket chain Wegmans is warning consumers with egg allergies against consuming a mochi-covered sorbet dessert that was recalled due to a mislabeling issue.\n\nConsuming food that was recalled due to undeclared allergens can result in a variety of unpleasant reactions for those with a related allergy, including the potentially deadly condition of anaphylaxis.\n\nApproximately 6 percent of American adults and 8 percent of children have at least one food allergy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nWegmans shared a recall notice for six-count packages of \"My/Mochi Peach Mango Sorbet\" to its website on Tuesday. The recall was initiated because the sweet treats \"may contain undeclared egg.\"\n\nThe recalled packages are marked with the UPC number \"0-70934-99868-1\" and lot codes \"337-24\" or \"341-24.\" While My/Mochi products are sold at retail outlets throughout the country, the Wegmans recall appeared to apply only to products sold at Wegmans stores.\n\nBut a spokesperson for My/Mochi told Newsweek via email on Wednesday night that the recall also affected \"approximately 100 Target stores,\" while pointing out that the entire recall was \"really small\" and involved just 1,200 cases nationwide.\n\nThe recall had not appeared on Target's product recall page at the time of publication. Newsweek reached out for comment to Target on Wednesday night.\n\nNew York-based Wegmans has stores in the District of Columbia and the following eight states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nThe recalled products can be returned to their point of purchase for a full refund. Customers with additional questions about the Wegmans recall can contact the company via phone at 1-855-934-3663 from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday to Friday or from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.\n\nWhile the undeclared inclusion of eggs might be of little concern for most consumers, those with a related allergy could be unwittingly stricken by several allergic reactions that can include death in extreme cases.\n\nAnaphylaxis requires prompt medical attention; its symptoms include throat swelling, difficulty breathing, a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. Other symptoms of serious allergic reactions include rashes, hives, itching, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping.\n\nEggs are considered among the nine \"major food allergens\" by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The other eight are milk, wheat, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, sesame and soybeans.\n\nAlthough fatal allergic reactions to recalled foods are rare, they happen from time to time. Last year, the recall of cookies sold by Connecticut-based Northeastern supermarket chain Stew Leonard's was prompted by the death of a woman who ate the cookies without realizing that they contained peanuts.\n\n\"This is a heartbreaking tragedy that should never have happened,\" Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection Commissioner Bryan T. Cafferelli said in a statement at the time. \"Our condolences go out to the family affected by this incident.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether the My/Mochi recall will lead to further actions. But recalls spurred by ingredient mislabeling in general are likely to continue somewhat regularly.","source":{"uri":"newsweek.com","dataType":"news","title":"Newsweek"},"authors":[{"uri":"aila_slisco@newsweek.com","name":"Aila Slisco","type":"author","isAgency":false}],"image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2560153/mochi-sorbet-recall-wegmans-food-allergies.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=c101ca5e9981586a14340279ab2ec756","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.003921568627450966,"wgt":474092553,"relevance":15},{"uri":"b-8492039402","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":false,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"04:21:42","dateTime":"2025-01-09T04:21:42Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T04:16:28Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://www.farms.com/news/meet-our-new-crop-committee-delegates-221864.aspx","title":"Meet our new crop committee delegates","body":"The 2024 nomination period for delegates positions on our four crop committees took place from July 2 - Oct. 1, 2024.\n\nIn total, 16 farmer members were nominated for 17 available delegate positions across the four crop committees and were thereby elected by acclamation. Among those 16 delegates, eight are new to their respective committees.\n\nRead on to learn more about the newest additions to our crop committees:\n\nCraig Riese farms in the St. Andrews and Selkirk area with his wife Crystal and two sons. Together they operate Westphalia Farms Ltd., where they grow corn, soybeans, wheat and canola. They added corn to the rotation in 2016 and currently grow about 800 acres.\n\nRiese's past and current industry involvement has included serving as a delegate and director with Keystone Agricultural Producers, as well as a delegate with Manitoba Pork. He has found corn to be a great addition to his farm and continues to learn and adapt to the challenges that come with its nature as a late-season crop.\n\nPatrick Gamache is a sixth-generation farmer who farms in Laurier with the help of his parents, grandfather and employees. Currently, their main crops are wheat, canola, soybeans, edible beans and corn, but they have also grown rye, barley, oats and meadow fescue. Apart from grain farming, Gamache was also a seed grower and co-owner in an ag retail business for several years, in addition to working with cattle.

Within just two months from 15 September to 15 November, 23,505 cases of farm fires were recorded in six states, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Delhi.\n\nThe winter harvest season in November and December is one of the major contributors to air pollution. For reasons such as failed crop output, time and money constraints, and low market prices, farmers set fire to their crops to quickly clear their fields. In cold weather and low wind conditions, a meteorological phenomenon known as temperature inversion makes it difficult for pollutants to disperse and rise, resulting in thick smog. The toxic fumes from the agricultural fields when combined with already high carbon emissions in the city exacerbate air pollution in the national capital, Delhi, thereby causing adverse impacts on health and huge economic losses.\n\nIn cold weather and low wind conditions, a meteorological phenomenon known as temperature inversion makes it difficult for pollutants to disperse and rise, resulting in thick smog.\n\nThe Indian government claims that a cumulative amount of INR 3,333.17 crores has been allocated since 2018 through the Crop Residue Management programme, with Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh receiving INR 1,531, INR 1,006, and INR 500 crores respectively. These funds are meant to subsidise sustainable farm equipment, build bio-energy infrastructure, and monitor air quality systems, thus incentivising alternative farm practices and conducting research and awareness programmes.\n\nAs multiple records suggest, these funds remain inadequate and could have arguably been better utilised. Firstly, the state government has constantly demanded to put more money into the crop residue programme, including the recent INR 1,200 crore plea by the Punjab government that the centre rejected. Secondly, almost INR 1,151.80 crores have been allocated only for field-based residue machine schemes, while other essential schemes like crop diversification remain underfunded.\n\nIndia's legislation such as the Air (Prevention and Control Pollution) Act (1981) explicitly states that burning any pollution-causing material except fuel is forbidden. The Supreme Court reiterated that stubble burning constitutes a violation of citizens' fundamental right to live in a pollution-free environment.\n\nWhile the laws are clear, political dispensation, not only at the centre but also in states, is a little lenient towards farmers, hesitant to take tough measures to ensure full adherence. Both the federal governments of Punjab and Haryana were slammed by the Supreme Court for not taking enough actions against stubble burning this year. In the wake of the mass farmers' protest in 2021, the Indian government also acceded to the demand to decriminalise stubble burning.\n\nBoth the federal governments of Punjab and Haryana were slammed by the Supreme Court for not taking enough actions against stubble burning this year.\n\nEnforcement has always been a major challenge despite existing regulatory schemes such as the National Green Tribunal, under which burning stubble is a banned offence with fines ranging from INR 2,500 to INR 30,000. Authorities face difficulties in penalty collection, and their visits to the farms yield little to no results. The environmentally harmful variety of rice PUSA 44 was banned, but it is still grown on a massive scale.\n\nPaddy farming, whose production soared due to many policies, including subsidised fertilisers, a guaranteed minimum support price (MSP), and free electricity, is responsible both for a significant amount of crop residue and groundwater scarcity. In India, paddy farming constitutes 41 percent of total grain food production.\n\nA water conservation legislation called the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act 2009, enacted in Haryana and Punjab, has also contributed to incidents of stubble burning. Under this act, paddy sowing can only be carried out in monsoon months as water-intensive crops such as rice refrain from sucking groundwater during this period. Paddy harvesting then takes place in early November, leaving only 10 days for farmers to prepare their fields for the next crop. Fearing that lateness in the next crop cycle can decrease output, farmers hurriedly set fire to the residue from the previous crop harvest. The recommendation by the Standing Committee on water resources includes revisiting the law and enacting restrictions in water-scarce regions rather than imposing a blanket ban on the entire state.\n\nThere are 150,000 machines available for crop residue management (CRM), out of which nearly 500,000 machines either need maintenance or have outlived their utility. A report says that at least 50 percent of those who adopt CRM eventually resort to burning stubble. One of the challenges faced by farmers who use CRM, such as happy seeder and supper seeder, is that both require an expensive 60 horsepower (HP) tractor to run, which stands useless much of the time. Even on rent, it typically costs a farmer INR 10,000. Moreover, hiring a stubble removal machine for a four-acre farm requires a waiting time of nearly two weeks.\n\nThe central government must develop and maintain a multi-crop infrastructure. Right now, it largely procures paddy crops as a part of its food security scheme and puts them under the safety net of a minimum support price. Meanwhile, non-paddy crops are excluded from the central government's price guarantee, therefore attracting meagre attention from farmers. A greater number of crops should be procured under the safety net of the MSP. Farmers' organisations demanded 23 crops to be included in the government-sponsored floor price, though a feasible plan is yet to be worked out. Had crop diversification been given preference in fund allocation over current subsidies on crop residue equipment, it would have been far more effective according to experts\n\nFarmers' organisations demanded 23 crops to be included in the government-sponsored floor price, though a feasible plan is yet to be worked out.\n\nStates need to replicate the Haryana Model, where over 30,000 farmers have pledged to grow non-paddy crops and adopt direct seed technology. In exchange, the government is giving out compensations for sustainable practices, and establishing industries in rural areas to ease logistical challenges.\n\nBesides this, a change in dietary preferences can also accelerate crop diversification, and consequently eliminate paddy farming, the biggest contributor to stubble burning. India's population requires vegetables and fruits in their diets, alongside wheat and rice, because vegetables and fruits are naturally low residue crops.\n\nWaste-to-wealth solutions, if conducted on a larger scale, offer a tremendous opportunity to transform India into a sustainable agriculture economy. The Indian government, for instance, has started several initiatives to produce bio-energy out of crop residue, including the setting up of bio-ethanol plants in Haryana and Punjab. However, there needs to be a clear-cut strategy to overcome several hurdles. The biggest ethanol plant in Punjab has already been delayed twice, while another ethanol plant in Punjab has been called off following a community protest over alleged environmental violations. Although the central government has sought to establish several bio-ethanol plants, the weak coordination between state and centre makes it difficult. The NITI Aayog report estimates that India's ethanol requirement has to be 10.16 billion litres to reach its ambitious target of 20 percent ethanol blending by 2025.\n\nThe Indian government, for instance, has started several initiatives to produce bio-energy out of crop residue, including the setting up of bio-ethanol plants in Haryana and Punjab.\n\nA study confirms that India can produce as much as 48.35 gigawatts (GW) annually from crop residue. Since crop leftovers could also be used as animal fodder, effective planning is required to strengthen market linkages and make crop residue edible. India, which is already facing 35.6 percent, 10.95 percent and 44 percent shortages in dry fodder, green fodder and feed materials respectively, will witness a massive demand for feedstuff.\n\nThe use of digital platforms can enable farmers and bio-collection companies to hire service machines and monitor real-time information on feed collection. Initiated by the Haryana government and Deloitte, a multi-local language-enabled app, Krishi Yantra, has successfully reduced the number of incidents of stubble burning in two cities.\n\nRemote sensing technology could be improved as there is a difference between the actual farm fires and figures published in government reports. Media reports suggest that farmers found that burning stubble in the evening and in cloudy weather would evade the eyes of monitoring agencies. When it comes to the Air Quality Index (AQI), the mismatch between the Indian count and that of global agencies calls for an urgent need to fix systematic and functionality issues.\n\nFarmers complain that the PR 126 variety, which has been suggested as a better alternative to PUSA 44, has low yields and crop defects such as broken grains. It is thus imperative to improve quality using scientific technologies such as genome editing.\n\nStudies reveal that the drawbacks of a smog tower and cloud seeding outnumber the benefits, given that they are expensive to carry out. Thus, there is an urgent need for innovation to make them cost-effective. Although the Delhi government sought to conduct artificial rain to curb the capital's rising pollution, it was denied permission by the central government.\n\nRemote sensing technology could be improved as there is a difference between the actual farm fires and figures published in government reports.\n\nWith more frequent dialogue between the federal government and farmers, stubble burning could be minimised. Civil society can also help the farming community understand that stubble burning not only afflicts the environment but also reduces agricultural production in the long term. In a survey conducted in rural India involving 20,000 households, 44 percent of the people believe that stubble burning does not contribute to air pollution, which indicates that there is still a long way to go to make rural India fully aware of the grave consequences posed by stubble burning.\n\nThe government can allocate more funds, and carry out a cost-efficient analysis of the CRM scheme to ensure maximum utilisation. Laws such as the Preservation of Subsoil Water Act 2009 and welfare schemes such as the MSP crop list need to be reviewed. Establishing a bioenergy industry at a greater scale would be a win-win situation in an energy-hungry India. There will be new opportunities for fuel generation while the cases of stubble burning can be reduced. The government must speed up its program for crop diversification, incorporate digital solutions into agriculture and invest in R&D to ensure that environment-friendly crops can be grown. In the end, an exchange of ideas between policymakers and agriculturists will certainly help farmers make use of crop residue.\n\nSadan Khan is a Research Intern at the Observer Research Foundation\n\nThe views expressed above belong to the author(s).

Other symptoms of serious allergic reactions include rashes, hives, itching, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping.\n\nEggs are considered among the nine \"major food allergens\" by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The other eight are milk, wheat, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, sesame and soybeans.\n\nAlthough fatal allergic reactions to recalled foods are rare, they happen from time to time. Last year, the recall of cookies sold by Connecticut-based Northeastern supermarket chain Stew Leonard's was prompted by the death of a woman who ate the cookies without realizing that they contained peanuts.\n\n\"This is a heartbreaking tragedy that should never have happened,\" Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection Commissioner Bryan T. Cafferelli said in a statement at the time. \"Our condolences go out to the family affected by this incident.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether the My/Mochi recall will lead to further actions. But recalls spurred by ingredient mislabeling in general are likely to continue somewhat regularly.","source":{"uri":"dnyuz.com","dataType":"news","title":"DNyuz"},"authors":[],"image":"https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wegmans-Sorbet-Recall-Over-Undeclared-Egg-Allergen.jpg","eventUri":null,"sentiment":0.003921568627450966,"wgt":474091831,"relevance":15},{"uri":"b-8492033526","lang":"eng","isDuplicate":true,"date":"2025-01-09","time":"04:10:11","dateTime":"2025-01-09T04:10:11Z","dateTimePub":"2025-01-09T04:09:50Z","dataType":"blog","sim":0,"url":"https://www.farmonline.com.au/story/8862617/queensland-sorghum-farmers-brace-for-potential-rain-impact/","title":"Soggy weather spells concern for Queensland sorghum growers with early crop","body":"Gregor Heard is ACM's national grains industry reporter, based in Horsham, Victoria.

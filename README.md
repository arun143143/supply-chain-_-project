AI-Driven Supply Chain Disruption Predictor and Inventory Optimization System
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced AI-powered system that revolutionizes supply chain management by monitoring global supply chain data, predicting potential disruptions, and optimizing inventory levels accordingly. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA for natural language processing (NLP) and data analysis, integrating with Google Sheets, and utilizing Slack or Email for real-time alerts, the system will provide predictive insights on supply chain risks and automate inventory adjustments. This comprehensive solution will enable businesses to proactively manage supply chain disruptions, optimize inventory levels, and maintain operational continuity in the face of global uncertainties.

Key Features
Accurate Prediction of Supply Chain Disruptions: Analyzes news, supplier data, and transportation trends to predict disruptions and their impact.
Dynamic Inventory Optimization: Optimizes inventory levels based on disruption predictions and supply chain reliability.
Real-Time Alerts: Sends notifications via Slack or Email for critical disruption predictions and inventory adjustments.
ERP Integration: Integrates seamlessly with ERP systems (e.g., SAP) for immediate inventory adjustments and reordering recommendations.
